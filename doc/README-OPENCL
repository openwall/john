====================
PRELUDE:
====================

You can use OpenCL if your video card - from now GPU - supports it.
ATI/AMD and Nvidia support it through their SDK available at
nvidia and ATI/AMD website.

Some recent distros have all (proprietry) stuff available as normal
packages. N.B. DON'T use X11 opensource drivers provided by your
distribution, only the vendor-supplied drivers support OpenCL. Either
install fglrx (for AMD) or nvidia dkms package or go directly with the
ones provided by nvidia and ATI.

You can also use OpenCL with CPU, mostly useful if you have several
(or loads of) cores. This sometimes outperforms the CPU-only formats
due to better scaling than OMP, or due to vectorizing. See Intel's
and AMD's web sites for drivers. Note that an Intel driver does
support AMD CPU's and vice versa.

This code is still experimental, try at your own risk. GPU should not
get overheated due to some protection in the hardware, however keep
an eye on temperatures (use "aticonfig -odgt" for AMD cards, or
"nvidia-smi" for nvidia cards).

This code has been tested on Linux, OSX and Windows, see doc/BUGS for
known issues.

OpenCL won't:
- improve your speed on very short runs (due to longer startup).
- work well in single mode due to using large sets of password (but some
  formats now handle this better by adopting work sizes).


====================
COMPILING:
====================

The new autoconf (./configure) should find your OpenCL installation and
enable it. If it doesn't, you may need to pass some parameters about where
it's located, e.g.,
    ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/AMDAPP/lib CFLAGS=-I/opt/AMDAPP/include
    make -sj4

To build without OpenCL, use:
    ./configure --disable-opencl
    make -sj4


ATI/AMD suggest you to use ATISTREAMSDKROOT env variable to
provide where you have installed their SDK root.
nvidia simply install it in /usr/local/nvidia .

The legacy Makefile assumes you have $ATISTREAMSDKROOT set up to point
to your ATI installation or you have $NVIDIA_CUDA pointing to nvidia
installation.

If in doubt do a

# updatedb && locate CL/cl.h && locate libOpenCL.so

to locate your path to the includes and libOpenCL.

Adjust NVIDIA_CUDA or ATISTREAMSDKROOT to your needs and
if something is still wrong (but it shouldn't) send
an email to john-users@lists.openwall.com for help.


====================
USAGE:
====================

You can use john with your favourite options and the corresponding
OpenCL format you need. If no --format is given, john will always
pick the CPU format. To use OpenCL you must explicitly select the
format, e.g., --format=wpapsk-opencl


====================
Supported formats:
====================

See output of "./john --list=formats --format=opencl"


==================
Vectorized formats
==================

A few formats will ask your device if it runs better vectorized,  and at what
width, and act accordingly.   A vectorized format runs faster on such devices
(notably CPUs,  depending on driver,  and pre-GCN AMD GPUs).  However, a side
effect might be register spilling which will just make it slower. If a format
defaults  to vectorizing,  --force-scalar  will disable it.  You can also set
ForceScalar = Y  in john.conf to disable it globally.

The following formats currently support such vectorizing:

encfs-opencl              EncFS
krb5pa-sha1-opencl        Kerberos 5 AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 17/18
ntlmv2-opencl             NTLMv2 C/R
office2007-opencl         Office 2007
office2010-opencl         Office 2010
office2013-opencl         Office 2013
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1-opencl   Generic PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1
RAKP-opencl               IPMI 2.0 RAKP (RMCP+)
sha1crypt-opencl          NetBSD's sha1crypt
WPAPSK-opencl             WPA/WPA2 PSK

If/when a format runs vectorized, it will show algorithm name as e.g.
[OpenCL 4x] as opposed to just [OpenCL].


=================
Watchdog Timer:
=================

If your GPU is also your active display device, a watchdog timer is enabled
by default, killing any kernel that runs for more than about five seconds
(nvidia) or two seconds (AMD). You will normally not get a proper error
message, just some kind of failure after five seconds or more, like:

  OpenCL error (CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE) in file (OpenCL_encfs_fmt.c) (...)

Our goal is to split such kernels into subkernels with shorter durations but
in the meantime (and especially if running slow kernels on weak devices) you
might need to disable this watchdog. For nvidia cards, you can check this
setting using "--list=OpenCL-devices". Example output:

    Platform version: OpenCL 1.1 CUDA 4.2.1
        Device #0 name:         GeForce GT 650M
        Device vendor:          NVIDIA Corporation
        Device type:            GPU (LE)
        Device version:         OpenCL 1.1 CUDA
        Driver version:         304.51
        Global Memory:          1023.10 MB
        Global Memory Cache:    32.0 KB
        Local Memory:           48.0 KB (Local)
        Max clock (MHz) :       900
        Max Work Group Size:    1024
        Parallel compute cores: 2
        Stream processors:      384  (2 x 192)
        Warp size:              32
        Max. GPRs/work-group:   65536
        Compute capability:     3.0 (sm_30)
        Kernel exec. timeout:   yes            <-- enabled watchdog

This particular output is not always available under OSX but you can get the
information using "--list=cuda-devices" instead, see doc/README-CUDA. We are
currently not aware of any way to disable this watchdog under OSX.  Under
Linux (and possibly other systems using X), you can disable it for nvidia
cards by adding the 'Option "Interactive"' line to /etc/X11/xorg.conf:

    Section "Device"
        Identifier     "Device0"
        Driver         "nvidia"
        VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
        Option         "Interactive"        "False"
    EndSection

At this time we are not aware of any way to check or change this for AMD cards.
What we do know is that some old AMD drivers will crash after repeated runs of
as short durations as 200 ms, necessating a reboot. If this happens, just
upgrade your driver.


====================
Multi-device support
====================

Currently only mscash2-OpenCL support multiple devices by itself. However,
all other formats can use it together with MPI or the --fork option. For
example, let's say you have four GPU or accelerator cards in your local host:

$ ./john -fork=4 -dev=gpu,acc -format=(...)

The above will fork to four processes and each process will use a different
GPU or Accelerator device. The "-dev" option (--device) is likely needed
because it defaults to 'all' which may include unwanted devices. Instead
of -dev=gpu,acc (use all/any GPUs and accelerators) you could specify them
explicitly if needed, e.g. -dev=0,1,5,6.

Or maybe you have two cards in a remote host called alpha and one card in
a host called bravo. Build with MPI support and use this variant of the above:

$ mpirun -host alpha,alpha,bravo ./john -dev=gpu,acc -format=(...)

The above will start two processes on alpha, using different GPUs, as well
as one process on bravo. In this case, the "-dev=gpu" option will be
enumerated on each host so if GPUs are devices 1 & 3 on alpha but device 0 on
bravo, that is not a problem.

If for some reason you want to run e.g. two processes on each GPU, just double
the -fork argument or the MPI number of hosts (using -np option to mpirun).
The device list will round-robin.

This distribution of John the Ripper requires OpenCL to compile.

If you don't have OpenCL, download install and configure it before
proceeeding.

Any bugs, patches, comments or love letters should be sent to
samu@linuxasylum.net or jtr-dev mailing list.

Enjoy.
