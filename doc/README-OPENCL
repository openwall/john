====================
PRELUDE:
====================

You can use OpenCL if your video card - from now GPU - supports it.
ATI/AMD and Nvidia support it through their SDK available at
nvidia and ati/amd website.

N.B. DON'T use X11 opensource drivers provided by your distribution,
only the vendor-supplied drivers support OpenCL. Either install fglrx
(for AMD) or nvidia dkms package or go directly with the ones provided
by nvidia and ati.

You can also use OpenCL with CPU, mostly useful if you have several
(or loads of) cores. This sometimes outperforms the CPU-only formats
due to better scaling than OMP, or due to vectorizing. See Intel's
and AMD's web sites for drivers. Note that an Intel driver does
support AMD CPU's and vice versa.

This code is still experimental, try at your own risk. GPU should not
get overheated due to some protection in the hardware, however keep
an eye on temperatures (use "aticonfig -odgt" for AMD cards, or
"nvidia-smi" for nvidia cards).

This code has been tested on Linux and OSX, see doc/BUGS for known
issues.

OpenCL patches have been lately introduced to add GPU support to john;
unfortunately, due to opencl design they shine when you have million
of password to test.

OpenCL won't:
- improve your speed on very short runs (due to longer startup).
- work well in single mode due to using large sets of password (but some
  formats now handle this quite well).


====================
COMPILING:
====================

ATI/AMD suggest you to use ATISTREAMSDKROOT env variable to
provide where you have installed their SDK root.
nvidia simply install it in /usr/local/nvidia .

Makefile assume you have $ATISTREAMSDKROOT set up to point
to your ati installation or you have $NVIDIA_CUDA pointing to
nvidia installation.

If in doubt do a

# updatedb && locate CL/cl.h && locate libOpenCL.so

to locate your path to the includes and libOpenCL.

Adjust NVIDIA_CUDA or ATISTREAMSDKROOT to your needs and
if something is still wrong (but it shouldn't) send
an email to john-users@lists.openwall.com for help.


====================
USAGE:
====================

You can use john with your favourite options and the corresponding
opencl format you need.

On some opencl formats there are two environment variables you can adjust:
these are $LWS and $GWS.

LWS is the local work size, aka the number of "threads" the job
will be split and sent to the GPU.

- If $LWS is not set, john will try to get the one
  best for your system. On some slow hashes, a good default
  is going to be picked.

GWS is the Global Work Size. For non-vectorized format it is the same as
Keys Per Crypt, the number of keys that will be tried in a GPU call.
- If you unset GWS, john will use a default work size, which depends on
  what format is used.
- If GWS is set to 0 john will try to get the one best for
  your system, BEWARE it will take a couple of minutes.
- GWS is highly dependent on your PCI-E bandwidth rate which at the
  moment is one of the biggest bottlenecks for opencl in john.


Once you have found the best LWS or GWS for your system you can do

export LWS=NUM1
or
export GWS=NUM2

to avoid testing.

Warning! LWS and GWS are highly dependent on the format you are using.
LWS and GWS are not yet in every opencl format john is using.

- There's no check for LWS and GWS values so you should know how
  to set them to proper values, if in doubt just use the defaults
  and unset them.


====================
Optimization:
====================

If you plan on using opencl only for incremental mode (which at
the moment is the one that gives the highest speed) it could be
a good idea to set up PLAINTEXT_LENGTH to a lower value than
32. Some formats honour the --max-length option, optimizing for
this.

- LWS and GWS should be set with numbers that are power of two.

- GWS should always be a multiple of LWS: you should always
  be able to divide GWS / LWS and get an integer number.

===================
Optional vecorizing
===================

A few formats honour the --request-vector option. A vectorized format runs
faster on some devices (notably pre-Tahiti AMD GPUs, and CPUs). If a format
defaults to vectorizing, --request-scalar will disable it. There has been a
lot of problems with vectorizing, possibly due to driver bugs so it's usually
not the default. The following formats currently support optional vectorizing:

krb5pa-sha1-opencl    Kerberos 5 AS-REQ PreAuth etype 17/18 aes-cts-hmac-sha1-96
office2007-opencl     Office 2007 SHA-1 AES
office2010-opencl     Office 2010 SHA-1 AES
office2013-opencl     Office 2013 SHA-512 AES
wpapsk-opencl         WPA-PSK PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1

When a format runs vectorized, it will show algorithm name as eg. [OpenCL 4x]
as opposed to just [OpenCL].


=================
Watchdog Timer:
=================

If your GPU is also your active display device, a watchdog timer is enabled
by default, killing any kernel that runs for more than about five seconds
(nvidia) or two seconds (AMD). You will normally not get a proper error
message, just some kind of failure after five seconds or more, like:

  OpenCL error (CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE) in file (opencl_encfs_fmt.c) (...)

Our goal is to split such kernels into subkernels with shorter durations but
in the meantime (and especially if running slow kernels on weak devices) you
might need to disable this watchdog. For nvidia cards, you can check this
setting using "--list=opencl-devices". Example output:

    Platform version: OpenCL 1.1 CUDA 4.2.1
        Device #0 name:         GeForce GT 650M
        Device vendor:          NVIDIA Corporation
        Device type:            GPU (LE)
        Device version:         OpenCL 1.1 CUDA
        Driver version:         304.51
        Global Memory:          1023.10 MB
        Global Memory Cache:    32.0 KB
        Local Memory:           48.0 KB (Local)
        Max clock (MHz) :       900
        Max Work Group Size:    1024
        Parallel compute cores: 2
        Stream processors:      384  (2 x 192)
        Warp size:              32
        Max. GPRs/work-group:   65536
        Compute capability:     3.0 (sm_30)
        Kernel exec. timeout:   yes            <-- enabled watchdog

This particular output is not always available under OSX but you can get the
information using "--list=cuda-devices" instead, see doc/README-CUDA. We are
currently not aware of any way to disable this watchdog under OSX.  Under
Linux (and possibly other systems using X), you can disable it for nvidia
cards by adding the 'Option "Interactive"' line to /etc/X11/xorg.conf:

    Section "Device"
        Identifier     "Device0"
        Driver         "nvidia"
        VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
        Option         "Interactive"        "False"
    EndSection

At this time we are not aware of any way to check or change this for AMD cards.
What we do know is that some old AMD drivers will crash after repeated runs of
as short durations as 200 ms, necessating a reboot. If this happens, just
upgrade your driver.

This distribution of John the Ripper requires OpenCL to compile.

If you don't have OpenCL, download install and configure it before
proceeeding.
