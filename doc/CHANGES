The following changes have been made between John 1.7.2 and 1.7.2.1:

* Minor bug fixes.

The following changes have been made between John 1.7.1 and 1.7.2:

* Bitslice DES assembly code for x86-64 making use of the 64-bit mode
extended SSE2 with 16 XMM registers has been added for better performance
at DES-based crypt(3) hashes with x86-64 builds on AMD processors.
* New make target for FreeBSD/x86-64.

The following changes have been made between John 1.7.0.2 and 1.7.1:

* Bitslice DES code for x86 with SSE2 has been added for better performance
at DES-based crypt(3) hashes on Pentium 4 and SSE2-capable AMD processors.
* Assorted high-level changes have been applied to improve performance
on current x86-64 processors.
* New make target for NetBSD/SPARC64.
* Minor source code cleanups.

The following changes have been made between John 1.7 and 1.7.0.2:

* Minor bug and portability fixes.
* Better handling of certain uncommon scenarios and improper uses of John.
* Bonus: "Keyboard" cracker included in the default john.conf (john.ini)
that will try sequences of adjacent keys on a keyboard as passwords.

The following major changes have been made since John 1.6:

* Bitslice DES code for x86 with MMX: more than twice faster than older
non-bitslice MMX code.
* Bitsliced the LM hash code as well: now several times faster.
* Significant improvements to the generic bitslice DES code: +20% on RISC.
* PowerPC G4+ AltiVec support (Mac OS X and Linux): effective 128-bitness
for bitslice DES, resulting in huge speedups.
* First attempt at generic vectorization support for bitslice DES.
* Two MD5 hashes at a time for extra ILP on RISC: up to +80% on Alpha EV5+.
* Generic Blowfish x86 assembly code in addition to the original Pentium
version: +15% on the Pentium Pro family (up to and including Pentium III),
+20% on AMD K6 (Pentium 4 and newer AMD CPUs are more happy running the
original Pentium code for Blowfish).
* Verbose logging of events to the global or a session-specific log file.
* Better idle priority emulation with POSIX.1b (POSIX.4) scheduling calls.
* System-wide installation support for *BSD ports and Linux distributions.
* AIX, DU/Tru64 C2, HP-UX tcb files support in unshadow.
* New make targets for Linux/x86-64, Linux/PowerPC, FreeBSD/Alpha,
OpenBSD/x86-64, OpenBSD/Alpha, OpenBSD/SPARC, OpenBSD/SPARC64,
OpenBSD/PowerPC, OpenBSD/PA-RISC, OpenBSD/VAX, NetBSD/VAX, Solaris/SPARC64,
Mac OS X (PowerPC and x86), SCO, BeOS.
* Bug and portability fixes, and new bugs.
* Bonus: "Strip" cracker included in the default john.conf (john.ini).
