	Defining an external mode.

To define an external cracking mode you need to create a configuration
file section called [List.External:MODE], where MODE is any name that
you assign to the mode.  The section should contain some functions
programmed in a subset of the C language.  John will compile and use the
functions if you enable this cracking mode via the command line.


	External functions.

The following functions are currently used by John:

init()		called at startup, should initialize global variables
filter()	called for each word to be tried, can filter some words out
generate()	called to generate words, when no other cracking modes used
restore()	called when restoring an interrupted session
new()		called when starting each base word (hybrid cracking mode)
next()		called to iterate during the hybrid cracking (see hybrid cracking) 

All of them are of type "void", with no arguments, and should use the
global variable "word" (pre-defined as "int word[]"), except for init()
which is called before "word" is initialized.  The variable "word"
contains the current candidate password to be tried, one character in
each array element, terminated with a zero.

The functions, if defined, should do the following with "word":

* filter() can modify the word, or zero out "word[0]" to skip it;

* generate() should set "word" to the next word to be tried, or zero out
"word[0]" when cracking is complete (this will cause John to terminate);

* restore() should set global variables to continue from the "word". If
there are no global variables needing restoring, an empty stub function
should be provided, or John will refuse to resume a session.

You can use an external mode on its own or with some other cracking
mode, in which case only init() and filter() will be used (and only
filter() will be required).  Using an external filter is compatible with
all the other cracking modes and with the "--make-charset" command line
option.

It is recommended that you don't use filter() or at least don't filter
too many words out when using an external mode with your own generate().
It is better to modify generate() not to generate words that would get
filtered out.


	Pre-defined variables.

Besides the "word" variable documented above, John the Ripper 1.7.9 and
newer pre-defines two additional variables: "abort" and "status", both
of type "int".  When set to 1 by an external mode, these cause the
current cracking session to be aborted or the status line to be
displayed (just like on a keypress), respectively.  These actions are
taken after having tested at least all of the candidate passwords that
were in external mode's "word" so far.  In other words, the actions may
be delayed in order to process any buffered candidate passwords.

From 1.7.9.5-jumbo-7 on, a third variable is defined: "cipher_limit".
This variable is of type "int". It contains the maximum password length
in bytes, either from the format definition or from --stdout[=LENGTH].
This variable should not be changed by the external mode.
Instead, it can be used to stop generating new candidates should the
password length get larger than "cipher_limit".

From 1.7.9-Jumbo-8 on, two new variables "req_minlen" (requested min.
length), "req_maxlen" (requested max. length) were added, reflecting
the --min-length=N and --max-length=N options.
Also, a variable "session_start_time" was added that is equivalent of
time(NULL) at start, ie. the current time expressed in seconds after
Jan 1 1970. This variable is initialized once, not updated.
Note: On a resume you will end up using a new value than was
originally used.

From 1.8.0-Jumbo-2, two new variables "utf32" and "target_utf8" were
introduced. The "utf32" (int) can be set from an external mode and indicates
that the word may contain UTF-32 characters. It will be encoded to whatever
target encoding is in use. The "target_utf8" (int) can be read by an external
mode and indicates whether the target encoding is UTF-8 or not (some modes
may take that into account when considering output length). See eg.
Repeats32 external mode (run/repeats32.conf) for examples.

From 1.8.0-Jumbo-2, 2 new variables were added for usage by the hybrid
scripts (which use the new() and next() functions).  These variables are
"hybrid_total" and "hybrid_resume".  If it is easy for the script to
compute total words which will be produced for a base-word, and to adjust
itself at resume() call to get back to where things were left off, then
these variables should be used. Within new() the total count should be
set in 'hybrid_total' before the function returns.  Within restore(),
hybrid_total should be set, AND hybrid_resume is the number of iterations
which were done in the prior run, and restore() should change whatever is
required within the script's global state, so that the next call to next()
will produce the correct next word.  If the script can not easily know how
many candidate a word produces, or adjust it's global state to start from
some random location, then within new() the script should NOT set 'hybrid_total'
and within restore() the script should also not set 'hybrid_total'. In this
case,  the cracker will call new() with the word, and then call next()
hybrid_resume times (throwing away those words), and then start processing.
The code was written this way, so that the entire code of new() and next()
did not have to be put into restore() in this type of script.

	The language.

As it has been mentioned above, the compiler supports a subset of C.
The supported keywords are: void, int, if, else, while, continue, break,
and return.

You can define functions to be called by John (the ones described
above), define global and local variables (including single dimensional
arrays), use all the integer operations supported in C, and use C and
C++ comments.

The following C features are missing from John's compiler:

* function calls (any functions defined as a part of an external mode
can only be called by John core, but not from within other external mode
functions);

* only "while" loops are supported;

* only "int" and "void" data types are supported;

* only single dimensional arrays are supported;

* structs/unions are not supported;

* pointers are not supported (array name refers to the first element);

* probably something else...

You can find some external mode examples in the default configuration
file supplied with John.

	External Hybrid Scripting.

This is a newer additional mode. It is somewhat like generate, however
instead of fully 'generating' words, the Hybrid mode is given a word
and then called repeatedly to morph that original word. To do this,
there were 2 additional functions created, and 2 additional ext_global
variables added to aid in session resuming.

Hybrid Functions:

* new() This function is called at the start of each NEW word to be worked on.
The script should do whatever is needed to setup it's state. This may be
counting letters in the base word, saving off the base word, or many other
things. The only time that new() is NOT called, is upon a restore() call
when the script knows how to easily restore.  In that case restore should
have things setup so that the call to next() returns the right morph of
the base-word.  So new() is not called, which would setup the script to
start over on the word.  If the format DOES know how to restore itself
to an arbitrary location, then the 'hybrid_total' ext_global variable
should be set before this function returns.

* next() This function is called 1 or more times. It should do whatever
transformation is needed, and the word[] array should contain a null
terminated representation of the transformed word.  When all iterations
have been completed for a specific word, next() should set word[0]=0 as a
signal to the cracker that this word has been completed.

* restore() This function can be written to do nothing. This should ONLY be
done, if there is no way to easily count total candidates or to 'seek' to an
arbitrary location withing the morphing results of the base-word. The cracker
code will run a brute force method to get to the restore location in this
case.  However, if there is an easier way to know how many total candidates
are created for a base-word, and to properly adjust global data so that the
next call to next() produces the right word (as do all subsquent calls to
next()), then this function must do that, AND set 'hybrid_total' to the
total ORIGINAL number of candidates generated from the base-word (not just
how many more are to come).  The cracker uses this value as a check that
the script actually is setup correctly, and no call to new() is needed
(nor any calls to next() which would be thrown away).

Following the above rules and functions, a external-hybrid script can do
pretty much anything required to transform/morph/mangle words.
