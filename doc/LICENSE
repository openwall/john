	John the Ripper copyright and license.

John the Ripper password cracker,
Copyright (c) 1996-2011 by Solar Designer.
Portions copyright (c) by their respective authors:

The optimized DES S-box expressions found in sboxes.c and nonstd.c have
been produced by Matthew Kwan and those found in sboxes-s.c by
Dumplinger Boy (Dango-Chu).  MMX and non-x86-64 SSE2 code corresponding
to Matthew's DES S-box expressions (portions of x86-mmx.S and x86-sse.S)
is based on Bruce Ford and Rémi Guyomarch's MMX implementation.

This version of John the Ripper is hereby being made available to you
under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published

	Relaxed terms for certain components.

In addition or alternatively to the license above, the following
components are available to you under more relaxed terms:

As specified in the corresponding source files (sboxes.c and nonstd.c),
Matthew Kwan's DES S-box expressions may be modified, redistributed, and
used for any purpose, so long as their origin is acknowledged.
Matthew's original files (prior to modification for John the Ripper) are

Dumplinger Boy (Dango-Chu)'s DES S-box expressions are also available

As the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based password hashing)
implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed a derived version
of this implementation in the public domain.  This derived version may
be obtained at:

	http://www.openwall.com/crypt/

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).

Finally, I have placed the CRC-32 implementation (crc32.c, crc32.h) in
the public domain.


	Commercial licensing.

Commercial licenses (non-GPL) are available upon request.
