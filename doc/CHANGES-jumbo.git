The following changes were made between 1.7.9-jumbo-7 and 1.7.9-jumbo-8:

magnum (731):
	Add a "Section [%s] not found" before outputting the catch-all
	  --list=?
	Merge fix
	raw-md5-opencl: Report human readable errors
	opencl_mscash2_fmt.c did not declare clear_keys static.
	Fix mis-use of CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE in a number of OpenCL
	  formats.
	Revert "Version change for Jumbo-7RC, and undefine
	  REPORT_OPENCL_WARNINGS" as this was only for the "jumbo-6-fixes"
	  branch.
	Add Alain's Truecrypt format as posted to
	  www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/07/18/3. Make target for
	  truecrypt_volume2john is missing.
	Use maxlen in dumb16 and dumb32 external modes.
	Make sunmd5 check FMT_MAIN_VERSION, so the same file works for
	  non-bleeding as well as bleeding. Also fix some Linux warnings.
	  FIXME: This version still fails self-test under OMP. FIXME:
	  Jim and Simon, add your license statements!
	Fix new sunmd5 format struct so it works with bleeding too. Also fix
	  the ALGORITHM_NAME enumeration to new-style. This now says it's
	  using SSE2 but apparently it is not, on my gear.
	Sunmd5: fix SSE2 for 64-bit
	wordlist.c: fix segfault reported in
	  http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/08/01/5
	wordlist.c: fix segfault reported in
	  http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/08/01/5
	Define MMX_COEF in x86-64.h and drop the workarounds in SSE2 formats
	  that were needed cause it was missing.
	Use clear_keys() for SSE2 buffer cleaning in a couple of formats,
	  instead of doing it in set_key() if index == 0.
	Backports from john-1.7.9.6-c6.
	Replicate Vlatko's fix in 487c44ce to build_kernel_from_binary() in
	  magnum-jumbo and downstream.
	pass_gen.pl sync between branches
	wow_srp: Use the OpenSSL version, revert the -lgmp from Makefile.
	  TODO: put some (default commented out) HAVE_GMP stuff in Makefile.
	Add HAVE_GMP to Makefile, default commented out
	.gitignore update
	sed -ri 's/\bfree\(/MEM_FREE(/g' *[ch] (and then selectively
	  commit most changes)
	Bugfix for previous commit
	Limit External:Strip to 16 characters even if cipher_limit is higher.
	Do not use cipher_limit directly in External:KnownForce, because the
	  length is fixed - ie. no shorter lengths will be tried!
	Change a couple more ISO-8859-1 files (not in -fixes branch) to UTF-8
	mssql12: drop obsolete comments about SSE2. Also drop the
	  UTF-8-specific version of set_key() as we're not working against
	  vector buffers anyway and enc_to_utf16() can handle utf-8 too.
	External:Subsets: Revert defaulting to cipher_limit because it's often
	  too long. Instead, use cipher_limit to cap the used length.
	RAR: #ifdef galore
	dmg_fmt: #undef HTONL before defining it (warnings seen on OSX)
	mssql12: Unicode fixes
	Oldoffice: Proper Unicode support
	Make opencl_DES_fmt.c compatible with bleeding's format struct
	des-opencl: Use .h files for OpenCL includes (.c did not work on OSX)
	Fix a benign warning in OSX
	The new Kerberos formats depend on Kerberos 5 libs and headers. This
	  patch make them non-default - you have to uncomment HAVE_KRB5 to
	  build them.
	Make new Kerberos formats' structs forward compatible
	Use ASCII copyright signs
	Makefile: change a couple of hard-coded gcc to $(CC).
	Update some build targets with custom CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
	sunmd5: bugfix and miniscule optimization
	EncFS: Backport some fixes that was committed only to bleeding-jumbo
	OSX: Only link against krb5 if HAVE_KRB5 is defined.
	Office2john: Support multiple files in one run.
	Office format simplifications. Avoid a lot of alloc/free and
	  memcpy/memmove even though they did not hit performance much.
	Office: regression fixes for last patch
	Office: Get rid of the rest of malloc()'s + some other misc fixes.
	Office: Move Unicode conversion to set_key() so we don't have to
	  convert the same password several times. Add all sample hashes
	  we've got, as test vectors.
	OldOffice: Move Unicode conversion to set_key() so we don't have to
	  convert the same password several times.
	Ooops. Fix pbkdf2-sha512 format struct for bleeding.
	Special wordlist rule for cracking old office documents truncated at
	  15 characters.
	If ran under MPI though not built for it, complain!
	Improve the "OldOffice" wordlist rule
	Show SHA-1 in oldoffice FORMAT_NAME
	OldOffice: Inner-loop optimisations and much smaller memory footprint
	  per hash. Unfortunately the gain was smaller than I hoped for,
	  but it may be better IRL.
	Office: Very minor optimizations. OldOffice: For "salt-only"
	  formats (non-hashes), BINARY_SIZE should be 0
	Fix for sunmd5 for non-intel hardware, submitted by Sam Novak.
	RAR: gws_test() made static.
	New format office-opencl. This first version handles only Office 2007
	  and a max plaintext length of 19.
	Office-opencl: Fix some compiler warnings.
	Office: Fix some over-long test vectors that was due to a bug in
	  office2john.
	Fix format structs for new formats so they are compatible with
	  bleeding
	.gitignore update
	Office-opencl SALT_LENGTH bugfix
	Office (CPU version), optimizations for 2007/2010, 2x boost!
	Re-introduce APPLE in opencl_device_info.h
	Office-opencl renamed to office2007-opencl, and office2010-opencl
	  added. Both use split kernels, so durations should not exceed
	  200ms (by far).
	Added a CHANGES-jumbo.git which is (almost) raw output from "git
	  shortlog -n --no-merges", and placed (the changes part of)
	  Solar's announcement of Jumbo-6 in CHANGES-jumbo (mostly as a
	  placeholder, it might need editing).
	Update CREDITS-jumbo
	hmac-sha1 bug fix: Certain optimisations did not take SHA_BUF_SIZ in
	  account. Very few builds pick the old SHA-1 implementation that
	  uses 320 bytes instead of the now normal 64 bytes but native OSX
	  llvm now does, so triggered the bug.
	Add a version of our shared find_best_workgroup() that supports
	  vectorized formats.
	Bugfix for d708f98 (find_best_workgroup_vector())
	Revert recent find_best_workgroup() changes; they were no-ops. Also
	  remove some older no-op code.
	Merge 1.7.9-jumbo-7 as released, and bump the "unstable" version
	  string accordingly
	OpenCL: Read the LWS environment variable in the shared find_best
	  function.
	Fixes for new opencl_device_info.h names
	Add "Rules:None". I have added this as temporary a dozen times. It's
	  useful in some cases for Single mode and it really doesn't harm
	  having it in place.
	Office OpenCL formats: Run vectorized on some platforms (including
	  CPU).
	RAR kernel rearrangement, preparing for a split. This alone made for
	  some boost.
	OpenCL Office formats: Mitigate GPU hogging with much shorter kernel
	  durations. Barely any performance impact but much better desktop
	  response during cracking.
	Add some license stuff to RAR format, just in case. The wording was
	  already present in clamav's unrar sources.
	Forward-compatible format structs for sha256crypt-opencl and
	  postgreSQL
	RAR OpenCL: Finally, split kernel into quicker subkernels. Lousy speed
	  so far but passes self-tests. We use a 64x buffer, and run a
	  non-destructive SHA-1 over it instead of copying and flogging
	  bits around all the time. This eats loads of memory but we are
	  forced to use global memory anyway after splitting.
	RAR OpenCL: Use byte-addressed stores in some cases, if supported.
	RAR OpenCL: Back to 1x buffer and use private memory in inner loop.
	  Limit sub-kernel duration to 200 ms for GCN. Use local memory on
	  nvidia.
	RAR: Tweak GWS enumeration. Also a workaround to get the OpenCL kernel
	  running on Mac MBPr with GT 650M. This does not make any sense
	  at all, but it works. It is clearly a bug in OSX.
	Office 2013 OpenCL format added with fair performance given the task.
	  Currently fails self-test on HD7970 for no apparent reason.
	Office 2013-OpenCL: Vectorize (but only for CPU).
	Drop some bogus logic from Office OpenCL formats. I confused local
	  work size with global ditto.
	Office OpenCL formats: Add benchmark comments (iterations count)
	Add option --status-every=N
	Add a comment about Kepler (sm_30) in Makefile
	Unify CUDA and OpenCL "human_format" functions.
	RAR: Fix bugs with OpenCL profiling. In gws_test(), we did not take a
	  changed value of HASH_LOOPS into account. Worse, in crypt_all()
	  we had the global profilingEvent sent with
	  clEnqueueNDRangeKernel() even though we did not use it. This
	  lead to a memory leak and a slow but certain death.
	Office OpenCL formats: Remove unused code for shared
	  find_best_workgroup()
	Fix an inner loop memory leak in most (22 of 24) OpenCL formats that
	  use the shared find_best_workgroup() function. NOTE:
	  opencl_cryptsha256_fmt.c and opencl_cryptsha512_fmt.c are NOT
	  fixed here. They need some other fix, for example reverting to
	  private functions or a fixed (semi-fixed) value.
	Revert patch 4f12506 and implement a cleaner solution: We now use a
	  pointer for profileEvent, and it's set to NULL after
	  find_best_workgroup() so no more events will be created.
	Office OpenCL formats: Now that I got profiling straight, use the
	  shared find_best_workgroup() for a little boost on some
	  platforms.
	Add missing FMT_OMP to Office OpenCL formats.
	Another tiny (and benign) cl_event memory leak fixed in
	  common-opencl.c
	OpenVMS format: forward-compatible format struct.
	RAR: Prepare to use the shared find_best_workgroup() function - but
	  don't. For some reason, it returns a suboptimal figure. Also, it
	  takes time.
	Office OpenCL formats: Revert to fixed LWS yet again. Auto-conf is
	  simply too slow and unreliable.
	--list=cuda-devices: show number of SP, if known.
	Some added information in doc/BUGS - that might be candidate for
	  moving to some other documentation because it's not really about
	  bugs.
	common-opencl.c: Support split kernels with
	  opencl_find_best_workgroup(). RAR & Office OpenCL formats:
	  Implement the above but still, use hard-coded figures.
	RAR & Office OpenCL: Enumerate LWS if explicitly asked to.
	common-opencl.c: Add a way to pass parameters when building kernel.
	  RAR & Office OpenCL formats: Use this (more to come).
	Make RAR (OpenCL) much more responsive, doing less per kernel call.
	  Print Office kernel durations while benchmarking (GWS=0).
	Office2013-opencl: Fix minor bug in enumeration.
	RAR: GETCHAR/PUTCHAR macro optimisations (vs. arch)
	RAR: Tweaks.
	Silly bug: The new --status-every option clashed with the original
	  --status option. Rename the former to --progress-every.
	RAR: Fix bugs in auto-tuning to device. Office2013: Less X
	  hogging.
	NETLM/NTLM/v2 formats: Fix a signed vs unsigned char bug, and make
	  case shifting UTF-8 aware (as opposed to just codepage-aware).
	  Also bump some limits to accommodate for UTF-8 encoded user and
	  domain names.
	common-opencl.c: Add get_global_memory_size(), and tweak
	  find_best_workgroup().
	Add NTLMv2-opencl. Well behaved but I/O-bound. Vectorized on CPU,
	  passes Test Suite. Full Unicode support.
	NTLMv2-opencl: Change hard-coded challenge length figures to
	  SALT_SIZE_MAX and fix a bug in salt_hash() (our salt format is
	  different from the old).
	NTLMv2-opencl: Only run vectorized on CPUs.
	Encfs: Trying to nail an OSX problem. Change a dynamic allocation to
	  using alloca() explicitly. Some optimisations while at it.
	  Problem went from segfault to FAILED (cmp_all(1)) but it
	  actually seems to be a problem with whatever OpenSSL version I
	  happen to use here.
	Drop an erroneous linefeed from --list=hidden-options.
	Revert "Encfs: Trying to nail an OSX problem. Change a dynamic
	  allocation to using"
	Fix for common_opencl_pbkdf2.c that hid the actual error output on
	  "SYNC FAILED"
	Fix a common mispeling
	Add missing error handling in all CUDA kernels. Also add some
	  information in README-CUDA about too high THREADS settings as
	  well as a specific hint from HANDLE_ERROR for the "too many
	  resources requested" error. Finally, add some missing stuff in
	  Makefile so a header file change will cause a rebuild of
	  wpapsk-cuda or pwsafe-cuda.
	ssha-opencl: Tweak the device auto-tuning, fixing several problems.
	Bugfix in md5crypt-cuda. If we clear any_cracked we must also clean
	  the outbuffer.
	ssha-opencl: Further tweaks for work size selections
	encfs-opencl: Make it possible to specify GWS. LWS can already be
	  forced due to the shared find_best_workgroup function honoring
	  it.
	Respect "iterations" parameter in odf (sxc) PBKDF2 kernel
	For some reason the OpenCL kernel for OpenPGP/GnuPG was using unsigned
	  long for 32-bit integers. Fixing this made for a 20% boost on
	  Tahiti but it did not help the nvidia, which fails with the
	  cryptic message "Module-scoped variables in .local state space
	  are not allowed with ABI". Maybe that is just another driver
	  bug.
	Some added information in GPU docs, regarding temperatures, watchdogs
	  etc.
	Rename doc/README.opencl to README-OPENCL for consistency with the
	  CUDA docs.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git and CREDITS-jumbo.
	Manual corrections of CHANGES-jumbo.git and CREDITS-jumbo
	Move some less used options from main usage output to "hidden"
	  (shown with --list=hidden-options)
	Add description of --progress-every=N to doc/OPTIONS.
	OpenCL: Apple does not expose get_compute_capability() so we need to
	  find out SP count using mory hacky approaches.
	Add Max. GPRs/thread block to --list=cuda-devices
	Add more info to --list=cuda-devices.
	Support for codepages: CP852, CP1250 and ISO-8859-2.
	Update doc/ENCODINGS with newly supported encodings.
	Split kernel and some optimizations for wpapsk-opencl. And device
	  auto-tuning.
	wpapsk.h: The prf_512() function was doing four times more work than
	  needed. This change boosts OpenCL and CUDA formats a lot,
	  decreasing the CPU post-processing. HD7970 went from 66197 c/s
	  to 89468 c/s.
	Trying to work around AMD bugs in ntlmv2 OpenCL format, or help the
	  optimizer, or both. The RAR and Office OpenCL formats were checked
	  too but did not contain such code.
	OpenCL kernels RAR, Office, NTLMv2, WPA-PSK: Drop all pragma unrolls.
	  The compiler unrolls anyway where sensible.
	wpapsk-opencl: Move all post processing from CPU to GPU or otherwise
	  out of the inner loop. Great boost! Also bump max plaintext
	  length from 15 to 32.
	Add progress indicator during GWS enumeration in all my formats.
	ntlmv2-opencl: Implement clear_keys() for faster buffer cleaning.
	Update .gitignore
	opencl_rawsha256_fmt.c: Add missing stuff for FMT_MAIN_VERSION > 9
	opencl_rawsha256_fmt.c: Add more missing stuff for FMT_MAIN_VERSION >
	  9
	Add null-hash test vectors to some unsalted formats that lacked them.
	Add max. memory alloc. size to --list=opencl-devices
	ntlmv2-opencl: Use up to 1/4 of GPU memory
	ntlmv2-opencl: Map buffer instead of enqueing transfers. This can be
	  changed with a #define to use clEnqueueRead/Write. Until now, it
	  was mapped *and* enqueued transfers, which was a bug!
	ntlmv2-opencl: Don't try to account for clear_keys in gws_test().
	ntlmv2-opencl: Revert 65071a1. Documentation as well as google results
	  are contradicting but apparently it was correct as it was.
	  Use CL_READ_WRITE_INVALIDATE_REGION if available (OpenCL 1.2)
	OpenCL formats: more complete release_clobj() and other tweaks.
	Extend opt_flags to 64-bit and move all Jumbo-specific flags to
	  the high 32 bits. Core now have 7-8 free flags, Jumbo has 24.
	The previous patch reset a FLG_NONE behaviour that Jumbo did not have
	  before. This had unexpected consequences so this is now reverted
	  (FLG_NONE is 0 again). Also a cosmetic (code) fix for loopback.
	New GPU options: --request-vectorize and --request-scalar. These are
	  only supported by a few formats. Obviously they are mutually
	  exclusive.
	ntlmv2-opencl and office-opencl formats: Never run vectorized unless
	  asked to. There's just too many problems (driver bugs).
	OpenCL formats Office/rar/ntlmv2/wpapsk: Add a clFinish in
	  release_clobj() for safety. With a little luck this fixes some
	  problems and I'll regret blaming the drivers :-P
	cryptmd5-opencl: Selective use of bitselect, use pinned memory and
	  auto-tune to device.
	OpenCL: Shared find_best_workgroup() tweak for vectorized formats.
	office2010-opencl needed the same workaround for OSX that office2007
	  had.
	Regression fix for 11ecdb0: loopback mode did not work because
	  wordlist.c mis-read the 64-bit options flags.
	cryptmd5-opencl: Allocate/map buffer per nvidia's best practices for
	  pinned memory. This involves creating an extra buffer that we
	  have missed so far.
	ntlmv2-opencl: Allocate/map buffer correctly. Quite a boost on some
	  devices.
	office2007-opencl: Allocate/map buffer correctly. Also fixed what I
	  thought was an Apple bug. Silly me.
	office2010/2013-opencl: Allocate/map buffer correctly.
	RAR & wpapsk-opencl: Allocate/map buffers correctly.
	Re-work some OpenCL error handling and add a margin for max gws
	ntlmv2-opencl: Use macros for MD4 and MD5 (because they are same
	  whether vectorized or not)
	Office2007/2010 OpenCL: Use a macro variant of SHA1, that is also has
	  an optimized version for the short-length SHA-1's (idea from
	  wpapsk).
	wpapsk-opencl: Use Milen's SHA1 on AMD, and Lukas' on nvidias.
	ssh-ng: Benchmark with crippled plaintexts, so we get real speed
	  reported: It's about 10x faster than the old ssh format.
	OpenCL raw-md4/md5/sha1: Fix buffer allocations per nvidia's
	  recommendations
	Revert "OpenCL raw-md4/md5/sha1: Fix buffer allocations per nvidia's
	  recommendations"
	EncFS: Reduce effects of an OSX problem.
	Update .gitignore
	EncFS: Fix a bug that for some reason only surfaced on OSX.
	Fix format structs for krb-ng, lastpass-sniffed and mongodb to work
	  with version 10.
	Add ULL to the 64-bit options flags definitions.
	Move the "hidden" options printout to options.c. Move --plugin to
	  "hidden" and move --save-memory above format list.
	krb5ng: Various optimisations, including: Check for known plaintext.
	  Always use fast PBKDF2 for short keys instead of choosing at
	  compile-time.
	krb5ng: Make a couple of functions static.
	Update .gitignore
	krb-ng: Remove (#if 0...#endif) an unused function
	xsha512-ng: Fix a format struct problem for v10. The split() function
	  prototype has changed!
	Fix for "testpara" and "generic" make targets
	mskrb5: Use Dhiru's approach from krb5-ng, giving us proper binaries
	  instead of being a "salt-only" non-hash format. The known
	  plain-text trick is now used as a short-cut within crypt_all().
	  The benchmark may indicate a slight regression for single core
	  but IRL this is faster and scales better.
	New format: krb5ng-opencl. Core copied from WPAPSK but now made
	  generic so future formats using pbkdf2-hmac-sha1 will be easy.
	Various tweaks: Remove the "MS" from krb-ng format name. Bump limits
	  for wpapsk-opencl up to what is actually supported by WPA-PSK.
	  Remove some redundant code from wpa-psk kernel.
	wpapsk-opencl and krb5ng-opencl: Support vectorization. Great for
	  OpenCL/CPU and probably VLIW AMD. Currently default to off, use
	  with --request-vectorize
	OpenCL formats wpapsk/ntlmv2/office/krb-ng: Revert to always vectorize
	  on non-GCN AMD GPUs. Not on CPU, because I see some drivers
	  doing a very poor job of compiling it although it should be a
	  no-brainer and produce SSE2.
	Vectorized OpenCL formats: Add parens against ambiguity, and fix a
	  whole bunch of kernel bugs that crawled in there while I was in
	  WAT mode.
	Last vectorizing bug hopefully fixed.
	krb5pa-sha1: Last change to input format (hopefully). krb5ng-opencl:
	  rename to krb5pa-sha1-opencl, incorporate CPU format changes and
	  support etype 17 as well.
	Rename mskrb5 to krb5pa-md5 and support our new input format from
	  krbpa2john.py. The old input format is also still supported
	  although I am not aware of any tool outputting it.
	valid() tweaks in a couple of formats. If we print a warning about
	  salt length, we better a) be sure the hash is otherwise valid,
	  and b) include the FORMAT_LABEL in the printout.
	Add a self-test that fails if a format claims SPLIT_UNIFIES_CASE
	  despite using fmt_default_split. This finds several offending
	  formats.
	Implement a split() in krb5pa-sha1 formats
	KRB4: More robust valid()
	krb5pa formats: Make the new split() functions fmt struct v10
	  compatible.
	KRB4 valid() fix
	WPAPSK valid() fix
	krb5pa-sha1 valid() fix (use the one from krb5pa-sha1-opencl)
	Include some AMD extensions to OpenCL device list.
	Self-test "valid() killer" that unfortunately will produce a segfault
	  instead of FAIL when it hits a bug. (only active with -DDEBUG)
	Rearrange the AMD OpenCL device-list items.
	OpenCL device-list fix: Need to init device_info[d] earlier.
	OpenCL device-list fix: strip leading whitespace from buggy device
	  names, and other list-device tweaks.
	OpenCL device list: Mute a compiler warning on OSX. Print PCI stuff
	  with leading zeros.
	Unicode: Ensure that our 'UTF32' typedef does not end up 64-bit.
	ntlmv2-opencl: Partial binary transfer, for a little boost.
	Speed up iterated split-kernel formats auto-tuning by not doing all
	  the iterations.
	Speed up RAR OpenCL format's auto-tuning by not doing all the
	  iterations.
	OpenCL device list: Do not print "cache size" if zero (it's usually
	  not true).
	pass_gen.pl: Change deprecated 'utf8' encoding to 'UTF-8'
	NTLMv2: Do Unicode conversion on GPU. Support for short lengths
	  (faster), honor the --length option. Drop support for
	  vectorization.
	Rename --length to --max-length and also add --min-length. Make Markov
	  and Incremental modes honour them. Add req_minlen and req_maxlen
	  variables to External mode for accessing them. Change a bunch of
	  existing external modes to honour them. TO DO: --min-length
	  support for Wordlist and Single. And regression testing!
	Add some sanity checking to --min-length and --max-length. Support
	  --max-length in Single and Wordlist. Also, add some MPI stuff to
	  fprintf calls that lacked it.
	Support --min-length in Rules (includes Single mode) and Wordlist
	  without rules. This needs to be checked for performance
	  regression, especially for the case where we do not use the
	  option.
	Bugfix: Do not list request-vector/scalar in list of --list options.
	Enable crypt(3) for 64-bit OSX targets.
	rules.c: Skip (as opposed to truncate) words longer than maxlength.
	wordlist.c: Implement --min-length and --max-length in buffer loading
	  when rules are not in use. Move handling of unbuffered
	  --min/max-length away from dummy_rules_apply(), and into the
	  main loop. --max-length will skip words, not truncate them.
	Minor fixes for --min/max-length
	wordlist.c: Implement --min/max-length for pipe mode too. And a bug
	  fix for unbuffered/stdin reads.
	ntlmv2-opencl: If max length is decreased, reflect it in benchmark
	  comment.
	Silence a bunch of compiler warnings emitted by newer gcc (the ones
	  that were my bad)
	Drop SPLIT_UNIFIES_CASE from clipperz format, because, well, it
	  doesn't.
	formats.c bug fix: We must call clear_keys() after self-tests,
	  otherwise first batch of keys to crypt_all() in the real crack
	  might be thrashed. This made for failures in hmac-md5, hmac-sha1
	  and mssql but I just couldn't find the culprit until now.
	Silence a compiler warning from the OpenCL binary-caching patch
	Quick-response to "events" (like key presses) for my loop-kernel
	  OpenCL formats. I'll let Claudio and Sayantan decide for
	  themselves whether to use it or not. Note that the clFinish() is
	  needed within the loop for this to work correctly.
	Use OpenCL's "spinning wheel" cursor during self-test, so we can see
	  where it ends. We could have it within benchmarking too but it
	  would affect speed. It's not 'erased' until after benchmarking,
	  so we can still see when a real crack really starts.
	Make "my" OpenCL formats adjust global worksize to the count argument
	  to crypt_all(). On my laptop, this decreases self-test time for
	  Office 2007 from 3:30 to 0:41. This is also good for Single mode
	  since we can now set min keys per crypt to local worksize.
	Fix a bug introduced in ef133e4 where a system with OS_TIMER=0 would
	  run into problems when the formats called sig_timer_emu_tick()
	  during benchmark. To fix this, I made bench_running a global
	  variable. Maybe there are better ways. This patch also fixes a
	  minor bug in erasing the "spinning wheel".
	When StatusShowCand option (in john.conf) is true, add the figure to
	  log as well.
	Add a john.conf option NoLoaderDupeCheck, for skipping dupe-checking
	  while loading hashes. This is for testing purposes only.
	Sayantan's formats: errors/diagnostics to stderr, please.
	Fix .gitignore after 6b66504
	SAP formats: Add a salt length check in valid()
	RAR format: Since the OpenCL code no longer falls back to CPU in
	  Single mode, break out the OpenCL code into a separate
	  rar-opencl format just like the rest of them.

	Drop "data_info" from raw-md4-opencl and raw-md5-opencl. It was
	  unneeded and just wasted time. Plus other tweaks.
	Use cached binaries for Apple platforms too.
	Bugfix for OpenCL binary caching. The old code depended on a null
	  terminator that wasn't guaranteed. Also, I'm not sure you can
	  pass a buffer to sprintf() both as destination and as one of the
	  arguments with defined results.
	Bugfixes for v10 format struct in opencl-encfs_fmt.c
	Fix a bug in options.c print_usage(), reported by scan-build.
	unicode.c: remove some dead code as indicated by scan-build.
	Remove dead increments in sapG, found by scan-build.
	Remove dead increment in sha256crypt, found by scan-build.
	Reset a "dangling reference" in single.c as found by scan-build. This
	  was not really a bug but we can reset it to NULL for good
	  measure.
	Comment out all "rar_dbgmsg()" from unrar sources, to silent some
	  tools.
	Fix a minor memory leak in rules.c userclass_expand() reported by
	  scan-build.
	Fix a non-issue in calc_stat.c just to silence scan-build.
	cuda_xsha512: reduce BSS with 70 MB or so and provide a done() embryo.
	opencl_xsha512: reduce BSS with 15 MB or so and provide a done().
	opencl_rawsha512: reduce BSS with 15 MB or so and provide a done().
	cuda_rawsha512: reduce BSS with 15 MB or so and provide a done().
	opencl_mscash2: reduce BSS with 8 MB or so and provide a done().
	opencl_bf_fmt.c: Reduce static footprint. More is needed but it's in
	  opencl_bf_std.c and can't be allocated in format's init() just
	  like that.
	OpenCL formats: rename all "release_all()" functions to "done()" in
	  order to prepare for upcoming core changes
	OpenCL: Change opencl_init_opt() to use the binary caching feature.
	common-opencl.c: Output "build" time even for cached binaries, in case
	  they take over 2 seconds.
	Makefile: Copy the OpenCL kernels using -p flag, so we don't
	  invalidate cached binaries unless actually needed.
	Bugfix: Cached binaries must include compile options as selection
	  criteria.
	raw-md4-opencl & raw-md5-opencl: Honour the -max-length option, for
	  performance.
	raw-sha1-opencl: Some optimizations, and honour the -max-length
	  option.
	Fix a silly bug in my MIN/MAX macros. They were not protected enough.
	Experimental: Let Incremental and Markov modes call
	  format->methods.clear_keys() after setting
	  options.force_maxlength to actual used length. This gives the format
	  a chance to optimize for that length if possible. No format
	  currently use this.
	Change whitespace to '_' in binary file names.
	OpenCL raw md4/md5/sha1 formats optmizations.
	common-opencl.c: No need to call include_source() with a cached
	  binary.
	common-opencl.c: Reflect that we are using a cached binary in case of
	  errors.
	No-op workaround for false positive in scan-build. See
	  http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-dev/2012/12/23/12
	formats.c: Add a self-test that puts maximum length candidates in all
	  buffer positions and then read them back to verify. This finds
	  incorrect claims of PLAINTEXT_SIZE as well as most kinds of key
	  buffer over-runs. It found 15 problematic formats right away.
	sapB: The new self-test actually gave a false positive on this format.
	  This patch works around it.
	raw-md4: fix a bug (SSE2 only) that made plain texts longer than 31
	  end up incorrect.
	Fix the max-length bug in Truecrypt formats. While at it, bump max
	  length to 64 because there is no gain in limiting it, and 64 is
	  the actual limit in Truecrypt according to
	  http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=keyfiles.
	Reduce risk of new self-test to segfault due to problems.
	Fix the new max-length self test so it only runs once.
	RAR formats: Max length fix.
	sapG: Workaround for problems induced by the max length self test.
	sapG: Regression fix for non-OMP builds after b15beb1.
	DMG format still segfaulted from the valid() kill self-test. It also
	  made a strdup() before even checking the format tag, which is a
	  Bad Idea[tm].
	PuTTY format still segfaulted from the valid() kill self-test.
	formats.c: Only run the "valid() killer" once, even if we have a
	  larger keys_per_crypt than number of test vectors.
	Fortigate: optimize order of tests in valid().
	IPB2: optimize order of tests in valid().
	Unified raw-md4-opencl and raw-md5-opencl again, and fix max length
	  bugs in them and in raw-sha1-opencl. The raw md4/md5 formats
	  should be identical except s/md4/md5/. The raw sha1 format could
	  also be very very similar but is not yet.
	Fix a typo in numerous OpenCL formats.
	Numerous bug fixes and optimizations in mysql-sha1-opencl.
	Max length bugfix in ssha-opencl. This format can be optimized a whole
	  lot but I don't have the inspiration.
	Fix max length bug in IPB2.
	Fix max length bug in IPB2 (last patch did not really do it).
	SIP: Remove some weird double work. More optimizations are possible.
	Rar-opencl: Reduce self-test slow-down due to max. length test.
	Office OpenCL formats: Reduce self-test slow-down due to max. length
	  test. SIP format: drop a now unused variable.
	Max length bugfixes in dominosec, epi and krb4 (all just fence-post
	  bugs)
	Oracle11 workaround for new max-length test problems (not really a
	  bug).
	Make encfs-opencl a little more friendly. It still needs a split
	  kernel.
	UTF-8 reverse bodge for the max-length self-test. Formats the take
	  UTF-8 and convert to UTF-16 use to triple the reported max
	  length, and truncate themselves. We must do the same, or we'll
	  get false errors.
	mscash bug when using codepage, found with new max. length self-test
	  in conjunction with the almighty Test Suite!
	BENCH_BUILD ifdefs for the new self-test, needed after adding
	  options.utf8 stuff.
	Max-length fixes for dynamic.conf, fixing dynamic_1001..dynamic1013
	Bugfix for a truckload of formats that did this:
	Fix Lukas' pbkdf2-hmac-sha1 so it can handle a max. length of 64.
	  There is no gain in limiting it (actually the new code is faster
	  due to optimizations). Affected formats: agilekeychain, wpapsk,
	  dmg, encfs, keychain, krb5pa-sha1, strip - as well as CUDA and
	  OpenCL versions of them.
	ODF: Use our own PBKDF2. Also, bump max length in OpenCL version - the
	  PBKDF2 is not made from the plaintext but from a hash of it.
	Change the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 in keychain.h to take an output length
	  argument and make ZIP and SXC use it instead of Gladman code -
	  2x boost!
	OpenCL fixes: 2x boost for ODF and 4x boost for SXC. These format are
	  still very rough.
	Improve max-length self-test so it better reflects real world.
	Further improve max-length self-test to avoid false positives and
	  catch even more real problems. This also fixes an older problem:
	  Some formats depend on all keys being set before calling
	  crypt_all() so now we do call set_key() for indexes that are
	  otherwise skipped.
	dynamic_fmt.c valid() bugfix: It did not reject overlong raw hashes.
	More dynamic_fmt valid() fixes. Still passes Test Suite so should be
	  OK.
	Dynamic bugfix. If DynamicAlwaysUseRawHashes = Y, we must disable it
	  for thin formats.
	Reduce BINARY_SIZE for OpenCL formats that was transferring partial
	  binaries anyway.
	OpenCL: Only replace whitespace with '_' in device name part, not
	  path.
	Some updates to README-OPENCL. This whole file should be reworked but
	  I am not the man.
	Reduce global work size to 'count' in more OpenCL formats, speeding up
	  self-test and helping Single mode a lot. Also some bugfixes. And
	  unify the various non-split pbkdf2 kernels we had, so there is
	  only one to maintain. RAR is currently b0rken.
	s/Alocate/Allocate/g
	More fixes to Dhiru's PBKDF2 OpenCL formats
	OpenCL pbkdf2_unsplit fixes
	More OpenCL fixes
	Silly bug in SXC and ODF found by Dhiru
	SXC bug tracked down, plus other minor bugs in SXC and ODF. Both work
	  now.
	ssha-opencl: Check device max allocation size.
	Make use of mem_calloc() in a bunch of GPU formats. Also change some
	  mem_alloc_tiny to mem_alloc and add MEM_FREE() in done().
	Makefile: Ensure that a change of common_opencl_pbkdf2.h will result
	  in re-compile of common_opencl_pbkdf2.o and
	  opencl_mscash2_fmt.o.
	More Makefile tweaking
	gpg-opencl fixes. View this patch with "git diff -w"
	gpg-opencl cosmetical fix.
	Make it safe to call clear_keys() for --stdout
	Drop an unused function in gpg-opencl
	Change the plugin magic in Makefile so formats are loaded in
	  alphabetic order of format struct names. Also, change the struct
	  for raw-sha512 so it will take precedence over other 64 byte
	  (128 hex chars) bare hash formats (currently raw blake2).
	Change name of blake2-512 to raw-blake2-512, so it doesn't get bullied
	  by the rest of the raw format gang.
	Change calc_stat so that the -p option enables support for 8-bit
	  characters as opposed to just mute the warnings. The usage
	  output already claimed this was the case.
	UTF-8 validity check in Markov mode.
	Fix for UTF-8 validity check in Markov mode.
	Full UTF-8 validity check in Markov. Markov mode now works pretty good
	  with UTF-8 provided you use -p with calc_stat and --enc:utf8
	  with Markov mode.
	Revert "expose markov stats file as command line option"
	Add usage output for mask mode.
	Register GPU formats first (even before core formats - this is
	  experimental)
	Revert "Mask mode bugfix"
	Load raw-md5 and raw-sha1 OpenCL formats before others.
	Do not trust the compiler to optimize away strlen of constants in
	  valid()
	Change the format tag of raw-md5-opencl to dynamic_0 just like the
	  others.
	Rename raw-blake2-512 to raw-blake2 and reflect SIMD usage in
	  ALGORITHM_NAME
	Fix lastpass format struct
	Fix a bug introduced with e82b54e. When running --stdout, we have a
	  limited format struct, and params.label is NULL.
	Fix a bug in rar2john - it tried to fclose() twice.
	Add big-endian versions of our dump_stuff() debug functions.
	Allow running an OpenCL build with no platforms detected.
	Drop UTF-8 test from Markov. The performance impact is not worth it.
	  For slow formats we could use an external filter.
	OpenCL crypt-md5: Get rid of global memory use in inner loop. More
	  effective buffer use and some other tweaks. Significant boost on
	  both nvidia and AMD.
	A few more md5crypt-opencl tweaks, mostly cosmetical.
	Shared (unsplit) PBKDF2-hmac-sha1 OpenCL kernel endian bug fixed (only
	  affecting non-word key lengths). And some other ZIP tweaks.
	Revert "Load raw-md5 and raw-sha1 OpenCL formats before others."
	Bugfix for Office OpenCL formats when running vectorized.
	Cludge for a problem where benchmark_timer is reset (because benchmark
	  time was reached) but the benchmark timer is still active,
	  leading to SIGALRM with no handler. If we ever saw
	  benchmark_running, we keep away for good.
	Revert f8bf37d and try a cleaner fix.
	OpenCL Office formats: get_key() bugfix, affecting UTF-8 mode.
	Unify output. "work size" and "work-size" are changed to just
	  "worksize". Not that it's more correct, but it's the shortest
	  version :-)
	Turn off OpenCL warnings. And bump version string to
	  1.7.9-jumbo-8-unstable.
	Drop an nvidia workaround that just affect 9600GT on 295.49. If
	  needed, we must make the selection criteria more narrow because
	  it makes krb5pa-sha1 fail on Bull.
	gpg-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	strip-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	xsha512-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	keychain-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	nt-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables, plus
	  optimizations.
	pwsafe-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	raw-sha512-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	Ignore environment LWS in common find_best_workgroup. Formats that
	  handle that won't call this anyway. Fix a minor bug in
	  nt-opencl: This format does not honour the count argument to
	  crypt_all() so we better set min_keys_per_crypt same as max.
	phpass-opencl: Honour LWS and GWS environmental variables.
	mysql-sha1-opencl: LWS/GWS (environment variables) fixes.
	Ensure local/global_work_size are reset in all OpenCL formats. When
	  running --test, we may otherwise end up using figures from a
	  previous format.
	raw-sha1-opencl: LWS/GWS (environment variable) fixes.
	Final fix to the SIGALRM problem. My previous attempt at installing a
	  restarting signal handler was correct but incomplete (only
	  worked on some platforms).
	Office OpenCL formats: Once again revert to using scalar code for all
	  devices due to what seem to be driver bugs.
	Common-opencl: do not release unused event. No harm done but it can
	  produce confusing debug messages.
	Wpapsk-opencl, krb5pa-sha1-opencl: Faster LWS enumeration (no
	  iterations).
	Bugfixes for the new restart code in bench_handle_timer().
	bench.c: For --test=0, make the OpenCL formats also do quick
	  benchmarking (for self-tests, not benchmark figures).
	CUDA fixes. The --request-scalar/vector options does not apply to CUDA
	  (yet).
	Less ambiguous usage text for --raw-always-valid
	bench.c: Include stdlib.h for setenv
	OpenCL: Print AMD-specific "board name" along with device name.
	OpenCL: Bump cached file name buffer to PATH_BUFFER_SIZE after seeing
	  problems with very long names (long device name plus long
	  options made for 130 characters full path name).
	Obey CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE in a number of OpenCL formats.
	bench.c: Add a linefeed after FAILED, and add output when all formats
	  pass.
	More LWS/GWS vs. min/max-keys-per-crypt fixes.
	The dreaded format struct stuff, for kwallet
	raw2dyna: fgets wrapper macro for muting compiler warnings
	README-CUDA: Now featuring magnum's "OpenCL vs. CUDA parlor", showing
	  how to tweak your CUDA formats using the values from OpenCL's
	  automatic tuning.
	SybaseASE: Allocate key buffer using calloc (should not be needed
	  though)
	Drop obsolete External modes (deprecated by the --min/max-length
	  options)
	Fix the "fopen: john.rec: No such file or directory" bug. It was
	  caused by path_init() not being called early enough. Not sure
	  who did that.
	Move the 500+ lines of --list logic out of john.c and into its own
	  file.
	dynamic_fmt.c: Mute compiler warnings about breaking strict-aliasing
	  rules. listconf.c: Add JimF in copyright blurb.
	Makefile: Add -Wno-attributes for muting loads of "warning:
	  always_inline function might not be inlinable"
	Revert 8a1b909 and introduce another change suggested by Frank.
	Fix a subtle bug in the OSX workaround for rar-opencl. Found by the
	  max-length self-test. Also bump max length to 22 and drop a couple
	  of obsolete "FIXME" in unrar code.
	Re-enable a 9600GT workaround in ntlmv2-opencl and wpapsk-opencl, but
	  not in krb5pa-sha1. This should work on Bull as well.
	phpass-opencl bugfix.
	Make dynamic_fmt fully movable between unstable and bleeding.
	Documentation updates.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo and CREDITS-jumbo (and the .mailmap that helps
	  producing them).
	Add Milen to CREDITS-jumbo.
	Lastpass: Bugfix in valid().
	dmg-opencl: valid() bugfix (segfaulted from the valid-killer[tm])
	common-opencl: I believe "source size" is poor wording for binary
	  size.
	Truecrypt formats: Change benchmark output to raw.
	PuTTY, GPG and krb5-pa-sha1: Change benchmark to raw. SybaseASE: Move
	  stuff from crypt_all() to set_salt(). It did not make much
	  practical difference though.
	Some more typos, and GPU README updates (supported formats list).
	OpenCL: Change the -DAPPLE for OpenCL build options to -D__APPLE__.
	Commit 04cf5f1 hurt performance for dynamic because data locality
	  suffered. This patch reverts it and use a union instead, to
	  satisfy the compiler.
	Relbench: Ignore the new "All nn tests passed self-tests"
	Single mode: Optionally load the full GECOS field (before splitting)
	  as one extra candidate. This is controlled with PristineGecos in
	  john.conf (and defaults to disabled).
	Use list_add_unique() for the optional PristineGecos loading.
	truecrypt_volume2john had CRLF line endings.
	clang debug target fix.
	Add self-tests that fail if you have a binary size > 0 but are using
	  fmt_default_binary() - and a similar test for salt. I believe this
	  does not emit any false positives but I'm not 100% sure yet.
	BFEgg: Don't convert to base64 in crypt_all(), instead implement a
	  proper binary() that does the reverse.
	formats.c: Degrade the latest self-tests to just warnings, and they
	  are also completely disabled unless -DDEBUG.
	Fix a logic error for some only-once warnings.
	Use correct value of BINARY_SIZE: GPU formats, and a couple Dhiru
	  missed (?)
	Revert "clang debug target fix."
	NetHalfLM and XSHA512: Alignment fixes.
	Backport OpenCL fixes that was only committed to bleeding.
	Revert "OpenCL: Change the -DAPPLE for OpenCL build options to
	  -D__APPLE__."
	Fixes to keychain-opencl, strip-opencl and agilekeychain-opencl that
	  were only applied to bleeding.
	Use -DDEBUG for the clang-debug targets!
	Office OpenCL formats: Better valid(), with CPU format as template.
	RAR formats: Implement a real bastard of a valid(). I will soon start
	  denying having written it.
	Minor self-test tweaks.
	Bwall's pwsafe patch broke builds using CommonCrypto. This fixes it.
	Fix a hideous bug in rar2john introduced by in 216cc57. A variable was
	  declared as just "unsigned" (taken as int) instead of "unsigned
	  char" which lead to incorrect output. Not sure why the compiler
	  did not warn.
	Correct ALGORITHM_NAME of mssql-12, pbkdf2-hmac-sha512 and the
	  Truecrypts. Use sha2.h for a number of formats that depended on
	  OpenSSL 0.9.8 (all but Truecrypt). Bump max length to 125
	  for pbkdf2-hmac-sha512 format. There's absolutely no point in
	  limiting it to 15.
	Fixes for builds using Jim's homebrewn SHA-2.
	Warnings from valid() should be suppressed if ldr_in_pot is set.
	Fix for ldr_in_pot.
	Introduce hash functions to hmac-md5.
	Introduce hash functions to hmac-sha1.
	Try to automagically detect and locate NSS, GMP and KRB5 libs, and
	  enable corresponding formats if successful. This is using Posix
	  find/grep and backticks. And pkg-config, if available.
	MPI: Limit scope of an internal variable.
	BLAKE2: Do not "secure zero memory".
	SIPdump fixes (CppCheck). Also revert using MEM_FREE() and mem_alloc.
	  That is not a good idea for a stand-alone.
	(Ab)use bench_running variable for keeping opencl_process_event() from
	  processing events while self-test is running. Otherwise a slow
	  self-test in combination with a short Save interval will thrash
	  the .rec file during start of a resumed session.
	WPAPSK formats has a minimum password length of 8. This patch adds
	  code to john.c that enforces this. We may want to add min_length
	  in the format struct later on, and remove this hack.
	WPA-PSK had a silly ESSID length limit of 14 that was already bumped
	  to 32 (the actual real-life limit) for the OpenCL version.
	  Moreover, it segfaulted on longer names. This patch bumps it for
	  CPU & CUDA too. For some reason the hccap buffer size is 36
	  (from hccap2john) so I kept that. Perhaps it's because it ends
	  up aligned including room for a NULL.
	Decrease PLAINTEXT_LENGTH for all WPA-PSK formats to 64, because that
	  is the spec. limit. More interestingly, the spec. says the
	  characters set must be 0x20-0xfe (printable ASCII) so we also
	  unset FMT_8_BIT.
	Add two WPA-PSK test vectors, including one for WPA (as opposed to
	  WPA2).
	Get DMD5 straight, and add OMP support. This format was seriously
	  broken.
	dmg: Make _memmem() static inline (will hopefully optimised away the
	  switch), enable 64-bit tests on 64-bit arch and disable
	  unaligned checks on platforms that does not support it.
	  dmg-opencl: Same fixes to _memmem(). ssh-ng: Provide an own
	  static inline copy of _memmem() instead of using one from dmg.
	Bump OMP_SCALE for DMD5.
	Unify Kerberos names.
	DMD5 format should not lowercase nonce hashes. They are used as-is!
	hmac-sha1 bugfix for get_hash().
	Cosmetical changes.
	SAP formats: Minor fix mostly for satisfying Valgrind.
	Fix an off-by-one in dynamic.
	Office: Use calloc instead of alloc, just for muting Valgrind.
	memory.c: When -DDEBUG, we turn mem_alloc_tiny() into a normal alloc,
	  to better track problems.
	Drop some #ifdef DEBUG, or change them to specific ones like
	  RAR_DEBUG.
	Wow-srp: This format is not case sensitive so unset FMT_CASE, and also
	  make the upper-casing in set_key() encoding-aware.
	Wowsrp has a minimum password length of 8, so add it to the hack we
	  did for wpa-psk.
	Drop a bunch of old formats from the unused/ directory. We can always
	  get them back from git if needed, or from old tar balls.
	Adjust a stack buffer after the recent bugfix to Office 2007. This
	  doesn't matter but it makes the code less confusing.
	Get rid of all use of alloca() and dynamic size arrays. Also fixes a
	  bug in keyring format: The "crack array" was not always reset
	  correctly. Makefile: Add OMPFLAGS comments for OSX llvm-gcc.
	  Truecrypt format: Use signed int for OpenMP loop, as required by
	  spec.
	DMG: Another alloca() found and changed to fixed size stack array.
	Dynamic: make sure valid() is looking at de-hexified data if
	  applicable.
	Pwsafe-cuda: Adjust BLOCKS according to count argument. Shaves a
	  minute from self-test and helps Single mode. Verified with the
	  Test Suite.
	CUDA formats: Adopt to count argument to crypt_all().
	ZIP: Implement a proper cmp_all() instead of returning 1 and relying
	  on cmp_one(). This should be faster due to less function call
	  overhead.
	Office OpenCL formats: avoid false sharing of crack array.
	Unify dynamic_fmt.c among branches
	Move WPAPSK test vectors to wpapsk.h and add a length 63 test.
	wpapsk-cuda: Some compilers did not like having the test vectors in
	  wpapsk.h so we define it out when building kernel.
	git grep -l '<stdint.h>' | xargs sed -ri 's/<stdint.h>/"stdint.h"/'
	Fix a bug in dmg formats, and add debug output.
	WPAPSK (CPU and GPU): Exploit same-essid weakness. Huge speedup when
	  applicable. See
	  http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-dev/2013/01/29/13 and on for
	  discussion.
	DMG debug bugfix (duh!), and a new test that seems pretty generic.
	dmg2john error message.
	dmg2john: Temporary fixes to handle large files and iteration count.
	DMG: Support iteration count. DMG-opencl: A bunch of fixes. This
	  format was not up to par with CPU format. Serious flaws fixed.
	  Add a known plain test for 8 consecutive nulls.
	SIMD support for NTLMv1 and OMP tweaks for non-SIMD. (cherry
	  picked from commit f3c6622be4054faf8992112c4c5101d5731baff1)
	Merge Solar's 2nd version of NETNTLM patch. (cherry picked from
	  commit 6ab65c5, manually merged from ea46591)
	NTLMv1: Very effective hint to the optimiser in cmp_all(). And
	  benchmark using crippled plaintexts, so we measure real-life
	  performance.
	NT2: Bugfixes to experimental OMP support (defaults to disabled).
	  (cherry picked from commit 884e277d25b7ae441ea1f1ee5aee335fd412ae47)
	DMG formats: Disable all but the NULL test, but bump that one to 16.
	  (cherry picked from commit
	  17b2c582debddf2ee482c18516e9d03cdbae8901)
	DMG: Re-enable the other plaintext checks (but not Apple). (cherry
	  picked from commit 5d47bdc00ac037456f53369099c860e1397946c4)
	DMG: properly re-enable plain checks, for OpenCL too. (cherry
	  picked from commit 7be93725d5b8b0ad9ac6a42735ce16fa5ad334a6)
	NTLMv1: Bugfix, and compact the hash functions (before merging the new
	  stuff to mschapv2)
	MSCHAPv2: SIMD support and exploitation of weakness just like NTLMv1
	  (the formats are very similar)
	NTLMv1 and MSCHAPv2: reject hashes in valid() as hinted by Solar.
	Bugfix for Jim's patch. Some debug functions were not static, and they
	  were included several times for GPU builds so the compiler
	  bailed. Also wrap that debug stuff in WPAPSK_DEBUG.
	MSCHAPv2, NTLMv1: After the 3rd DES block check in valid(), cache the
	  indexes so we don't have to loop again in binary().
	Truecrypt: replace a dynamic array with alloc/free. The format is so
	  slow this does not hurt performance at all.
	NTLMv1 & MSCHAPv2: Use multiple blocks for the SSE version (still
	  single threaded) for bumping "many salts" speed. Actually we
	  bump it to the ceiling of what JtR can report - the output is
	  capped at 4294M c/s.
	bench.c: Support benchmark speeds over 2^32.
	NTLMv1/MSCHAPv2: Use memset for bitmap if more than 200 keys per
	  crypt.
	NT2, NTLMv1, MSCHAPv2 tweaks for experimental OMP+SSE2.
	Dynamic: Bugfix for MMX (I think it's right, I can't link it).
	Raw MD4/MD5: MMX fixes.
	More MMX fixes, including a cludge in the max-length self-test, for
	  MMX formats that use total_len.
	dynamic.c: Bugfix.
	Use DO_ALIGN macros in Jumbo .S files.
	Portability fixes from building on ancient Sparc Solaris 32-bit.
	MSCHAPv2 & NTLMv1: Emit a warning after loading 100 c/r pairs,
	  informing about slow loading and alternative formats.
	  Re-introduce the old versions as mschapv2-naive and
	  netntlmv1-naive. Also fix the DES caching in NETNTLM: it may be
	  called from prepare() so the cache must be checked not only in
	  binary() but also in valid().
	o5logon: Minor optmizations.
	CUDA device list: Add PCI id to output, and replace a deprecated
	  parameter with a new, getting more detail.
	Add any_cracked to a bunch of OpenCL formats that use crack array.
	Add "naive" to the ALGORITHM_NAME for old load-fast-run-slow versions
	  of MSCHAPv2/NTLMv1, as in [32/64 naive]
	Add wpapcap2john to .gitignore.
	GPG: Optimizations, and bump max length to 32.
	Endianness & alignment fixes from testing on a Sparc32.
	More BE and alignment fixes. Some problems were in shared code in
	  unicode.c and the problems has been fixed backwards until now.
	  Most unicode.c functions convert/process UTF-16LE *regardless of
	  arch* and any endian fixes must account for that (normally none
	  is needed).
	Make itoa64 and the likes const.
	Crypt-SHA formats: Use a ROUNDS_MIN of 1.
	pbkdf2-hmac-sha1: Support OSX 10.8 from "the Dave Grohl tool" as well
	  as GRUB hashes, without converting them. We support hashes
	  longer than 64 bytes but we don't calculate/verify past 64 even
	  in cmp_exact() - the chance for such a collision is
	  slim-to-none.
	pbkdf2-hmac-sha1: Do a complete calculation & verify for full binary
	  size, just for good measure.
	pbkdf2-hmac-sha512: Improve the warning messages given for partial
	  matches.
	Endian fixes for BFEgg, wpapsk, pbkdf2-hmac-sha152, pwsafe and shared
	  pbkdf2-hmac-sha1. Also a bugfix for openvms but it still
	  segfaults for me. This is now the only format that doesn't pass
	  self-test.
	Drop run-time version checks for NSS that would be bad if run-time lib
	  is older than build-time one.
	Mscash: Get rid of compiler warnings on linux-ppc32.
	Alignment fixes.
	Rules.c bugfix for -max-length. Format's max length is already
	  adjusted down to max-length, and the RULE macro would do an
	  unwanted incrementaion.
	Fix indentation for sha2[ch] before merging it to bleeding. This is a
	  pure whitespace fix.
	On second thought, use the SHA2 version that was in bleeding instead.
	  Also try to mitigate a bogus strict aliasing warning. We are
	  already using a proper union for all I can see.
	Mute harmless compiler warnings if MIN() already defined.
	Better fix against that alleged strict-aliasing violation.
	Move md5_eq.c to unused.
	Remove md5_eq.o from Makefile.
	formats.c: Stop trying to use system's strnlen(), instead always use
	  our supplied fmt_strnlen(). We could move it to misc.c too at
	  some point.
	Revert SHA2 strict-aliasing fixes. They did not work at all for BE.
	We can force Jim's generic SHA-2 with -DFORCE_GENERIC_SHA2. This patch
	  adds a way to force OpenSSL over CommonCrypto, using
	  -DFORCE_OPENSSL_SHA2.
	Alignment fixes
	Mute a warning for generic target.
	Merge the current MSCHAPv2 naive format (with FreeRadius support) to
	  Deepika's bitsliced format. Then drop the original format and
	  use BS format as "naive". Lots of whitespace changes, view with
	  -w.
	DES BS plain SSE asm: Properly underscore P if applicable. It works on
	  OSX anyway but I'm not sure it will on others that
	  -DUNDERSCORES.
	Alignment fix for mschapv2-bs
	MSCHAPv2-BS: Merge two loops into one. This made a 5% boost here.
	MSCHAPv2 BS: #ifdefs for FMT_ flags
	Add some formats to benchmark-unify.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git & CREDITS-jumbo.
	I always end up confusing crypt(3) base64 with MIME Base64: Add some
	  comments.
	Fix a slight bug in sha512crypt binary() that could never surface. It
	  was processing the trailing NULL. Also drop some copy-paste
	  artefacts.
	Some Kerberos libs are not thread safe, but fortunately we can find
	  out using the krb5_is_thread_safe() call.
	Decrease OMP_SCALE in a number of formats. This number needs to be
	  tweaked for each format, not just copied from a template.
	listconf.c: Rewrite the formats list function. It was overly complex
	  and buggy.
	Add format groups "opencl", "cuda", "cpu" and "gpu" for use with
	  --test as well as with things like "--list=formats" and so on.
	  Also allow wildcard in the end, as in wpapsk* or krb5*.
	listconf.c: Suppress leading space in benchmark_comment.
	Document --format group aliases/wildcards.
	OpenCL DES: Honour device limit for LWS.
	Documentation updates.
	Disable the max-length self-test unless -DDEBUG.
	NT2: Five percent boost for codepage encoding, from optimizations in
	  set_key().
	raw-md5u: Three percent boost for codepage encoding, from
	  optimizations in set_key().
	ntlmv1/mschapv2: Five percent boost for codepage encoding, from
	  optimizations in set_key().
	mssql05: Optimizations in set_key() for codepage encoding.
	DES-opencl: Safer LWS capping (ensure GWS is still multiple of LWS).
	ODF formats (all three): Handle content.xml sizes less than 1024 bytes
	  correctly.
	ODF formats: Make valid() a little more picky about hex length.
	Add OSX clang-debug target.
	Add macosx-x86-sse2-opencl (ie. 32-bit) build target.
	uint64_t vs OpenCL fixes. In OpenCL, long is always 64-bit while long
	  long (if supported at all) is 128-bit. On host side, we use
	  "stdint.h" (not <stdint.h>).
	Use "stdint.h" in pbkdf2-hmac-sha512 format.
	DMG formats bugfix for "0 iterations" (assume 1000).
	Truecrypt: Simplify cmp_all(), unfortunately for no performance gain.
	dmg2john: bugfix.
	dmg2john: Use base name of file name in output.
	DMG formats: Serious bug fixes for 3DES v1 images. This fixes the
	  problem with false positives as well as an even worse one: false
	  negatives o.O
	Add wpapcap2john from bleeding-jumbo.
	uaf2john: Do not support writing to outfile, only to stdout. And add a
	  make target.
	zip2john: Use base name of filename for login field.
	MSCHAPv2 & NTLMv1: Smaller hot array. 25% boost for many salts, a
	  couple for one salt. Also enable OMP for SSE2.
	MSCHAPv2 & NTLMv1: Again disable OMP for SSE2 - it works fine on some
	  CPUs but not on others.
	Make odf2john work with python 2.6 (as well as 2.7).
	Change odf2john so we fall back to the deprecated function only if the
	  newer one is not supported.
	Fix SAVE= timer similar to Costin's patch.
	Fixes for the recent timer changes. Fixes a bug introduced for
	  --max-run-time where a resumed session would immediately abort
	  again. And if OS_TIMER, we only call status_get_time() if
	  --max-run-time or --progress-every was given.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git and CREDITS-jumbo.
	Document --request-vector and --request-scalar options in
	  README-OPENCL.
	mscash2-opencl: Fix for forced LWS larger than kernel's max.
	Document the OSX problem with OpenCL kernel header files.
	Wordlist bug fixes: Reject wordlist containing NULL bytes, and handle
	  inconsequent line feeds (eg. spurious CR within a line). This fix
	  will do for Jumbo-8 so we don't introduce new problems.
	cisco2john: Fixes after testing with lots of real config files. And
	  add some more stuff to seed output (hostname, communities).
	Fix the postgre format: Rename it to postgres, including the tag. The
	  old format is still supported. Also improve valid().
	Rename the postgre source file too o.O
	Some format name changes to clarify what they are.
	s/Staroffice/StarOffice/
	Add CXX variable to Makefile. Add separate PROJ_ sections for C++ as
	  well as pcap, so John does not fail building even if they do.
	  Also add uaf2john and truecrypt_volume2john to the main targets
	  and move office2john to unused.
	Makefile tweaks.
	uaf2john: Fix an aliasing problem.
	Fix another warning in wpapcap2john (fread return value).
	Fix generic build after the timer fixes.
	Move wpapcap2john from PROJ_PCAP to PROJ - it does not depend on
	  libpcap!
	Revert 8e992e4 and instead bump RULE_BUFFER_SIZE in params.h by 4. We
	  should look into this more closely but this will do for now.
	Makefile: Add a "Done." after building the pcap targets.
	Fix valid() in ntlmv2-opencl. It counted salt length incorrectly.
	pass_gen.pl: Support UTF-8 for -salt argument when -utf8 option is
	  given.
	Stop user from trying to use any encoding other than iso-8859-1 with
	  formats that lack support for it. It would just end up in false
	  negatives.
	Drop bogus FMT_UTF8 flag from Truecrypt.
	Change MPI reduction for benchmarks for accurate average speeds. Also,
	  reduce the int64 properly (only affects 32-bit or BE systems).
	Update README-mpi.
	Comment out all atexit(done) in OpenCL formats and let the OS do the
	  clean-up. Otherwise we got segfaults in the end after a --test
	  run. The real fixes are already present in bleeding branch.
	CUDA formats: Tweak default THREADS*BLOCKS so they work on weaker
	  devices.
	Dynamic: Change name of "salted Cisco PIX" to "Cisco ASA"
	Copy the improved ZIP valid() to the OpenCL version of same format.
	Refuse to translate \x00 into a null in user classes.
	Add external mode filters for UTF-8 validation. This is slow though.
	Rename NETNTLM_old_fmt_plug.c to NETNTLM_bs_fmt_plug.c.
	Change self-test use of set_key("", index) into something that
	  actually passes a large enough buffer for any use.
	Change self-test use of set_key(current->plaintext, index) into
	  something that actually passes a large enough buffer for any
	  use.
	Sparc fixes. Latest optimization of mschap/ntlm formats broke BE.
	PDF format still used the Bad Idea[tm] version of valid().
	Add missing deallocations in OpenCL DMG & RAR formats' valid().
	SAP F/G: Bump maximum length. We over-ran a buffer with the latest
	  self-tests.
	Bug fixes to thin dynamic formats PHPS, formspring, mediawiki, osc and
	  phpassMD5. They over-ran buffer when given bad input files.
	More robust valid() in salted sha1 / nsldap formats.
	Do some actual validation in SIP valid().
	Actually, while at it we should just as well validate it is lower-case
	  hex.
	WOW-SRP fixes. Not sure I found all, this is a mess.
	rar2john big-endian fixes for Unicode filenames in RAR.
	Makefile tweaks for JOHN_CFLAGS etc.
	Canonical fixes for new tcphdr.h (failed on Sparc)
	Revert "JtR-Dynamic_validation_raw_hashes-2.patch". It made things
	  worse.
	Macros for prefixing MD[45]_(Init|Update|Final) with "john_" for
	  avoiding clashes with OpenSSL library.
	Endian stuff.
	Drop un-needed header in ssha-opencl.
	Add macosx-x86-64-native build target. To use it, you need to copy
	  osx_as_wrapper.sh (from the src directory) to /usr/local/bin/as or
	  to some other directory (but the script MUST be called 'as') and
	  ensure this directory is first in your $PATH.
	Precedence: MSCHAPv2 should pick sploit version over BS one.
	Generic crypt format bugfix.
	Testpara vs. HAVE_OPENSSL fix.
	kwallet2john: Handle multiple files, and strip suffix and path from
	  login.
	truecrypt_volume2john: Use filename as login field, and convert to a
	  john symlink.
	Makefile fixes for OSX 32-bit cross-compile.
	Bugfix for memory.c under -DDEBUG. In order to easier track bugs,
	  mem_alloc_tiny() is changed to a normal alloc. But it was supposed
	  to still maintain requested alignment!
	Dynamic bugfix for $HEX$.
	Change the way -DDEBUG affects mem_alloc_tiny(). The outcome is
	  practically the same but this is cleaner.
	Revert "Change the way -DDEBUG affects mem_alloc_tiny(). The outcome
	  is practically"
	Final canonical change for -DDEBUG versus mem_alloc_tiny.
	Do not misalign SSE2 buffers when --save-memory=3 or above. The
	  previous fix did not catch all cases.
	Relbench tweaks, for ignoring warnings.
	OMP_SCALE tweaks. There are massive gains to win in some formats. All
	  OMP formats should be revised, but there are so many :-/
	Fixes for a couple of make targets.
	Drop inconsistent paths in the auto-conf hack.
	Drop the wchar stuff from gpg2john. 8-bit GECOS now works fine.
	Netscreen: Better valid().
	DMD5: Better valid().
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git and CREDITS-jumbo.
	More restrictive valid() in nsldap, salted-sha1 and ssha-opencl.
	Comment out dynamic_1028. It was using un-implemented functions...
	Improve valid() in all MSCHAPv2 and NETNTLMv2 formats.
	Remove unused variable from agilekeychain-opencl.
	doc/MARKOV note about UTF-8 filter.
	Revert "SIP valid() fix."
	Copyright blurb.
	VMS: Better valid().
	Drop unused variable from VMS.
	Merge recent sxc fixes to sxc-opencl.
	Merge a whole bunch of fixes made to CPU formats, to the OpenCL ones.
	  Conflicts: 	src/opencl_agilekeychain_fmt.c
	Updated doc/BUGS for unstable.
	Typo in README-OPENCL.
	Update .mailmap for git shortlog.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git (CREDITS-jumbo does not need update).
	Document some requirements in doc/INSTALL.
	100% white-space cleaning.
	Change name from 1.7.9-jumbo-8-unstable to 1.7.9-jumbo-8-RC
	Change --raw-always-valid (et al) to --bare-always-valid to avoid
	  confusion.
	Documentation updates.
	Add a line to --list=hidden-options:
	Fix a cosmetic bug when listing formats with wildcards that match
	  dynamic.
	Fix a couple of problems with raw-sha1-opencl. And while at it, bump
	  max length to 55 and use "compressed" key buffer for a nice
	  boost.
	mkvcalcproba: Support reading from stdin.
	genmkvpwd: Change %lld to %llu for correct printing of large numbers.
	bash-completion: Drop trailing whitespace.
	bash-completion: Redirect dynamic.conf errors to /dev/null.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git (CREDITS-jumbo needed no change).
	Add repeats16 and repeats32 external modes (from the obsolete contest
	  branch).
	Update CREDITS-jumbo & CHANGES-jumbo.git.
	Add a comment in ext_init explaining a confusing bail-out.
	Endianness fixes in Blake.
	Bad wordlist.c bug fixed, triggered when running -loop under MPI.
	Bugfix for pbkdf2 CPU/OpenCL/CUDA code. Bug may have affected several
	  formats where salt length was larger than 23. Thanks to Marcus
	  Desto for reporting.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git (CREDITS-jumbo needed no change).
	Fix a bug where -DDEBUG would cause an infinite loop in
	  mem_alloc_tiny() because MEM_ALLOC_SIZE is set to zero
	  (Jumbo-specific) and we ended up never breaking out of the while
	  loop. Thanks to bytebieger for noticing the problem and
	  patiently convince me.
	Fix another potential problem with -DDEBUG vs. mem_alloc_tiny().
	Print human readable OpenSSL version string with --list=build-info.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo & CREDITS-jumbo.git
	Use the recent mem_alloc_tiny() bugfix for size zero even when not
	  -DDEBUG because returning a pointer might be asking for problems.
	Unicode bugfix for OpenCL Office formats.
	raw-sha1-opencl: Fix bug where obsolete code that only handled up
	  to length 23 was accidentally used. And drop the obsolete code.
	wpapcap2john: Add SSID in "user" field for Single mode use.
	hccap2john: Add SSID in "user" field for Single mode use.
	Make Oracle 10 format more robust (allow lower-case salts even when
	  prepare() is not used).
	Another tweak to the mem_alloc_tiny() vs. -DDEBUG issue.
	wpapcap2john: Ensure we don't overrun SSID buffer with overlong tags,
	  and print a debug message. Thanks to bytebieger for reporting
	  this issue. We still do not know the cause. See
	  https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/pull/366 for
	  discussion.
	NVCC tweaks (mostly comments, but add -fmad=true) in Makefile.
	Fix an obscure bug in mscash where an overlong key would truncate
	  to 28 instead of 27 in UTF-8 mode. NT already had a fix for it so
	  unify the code for them.
	Protect a CUDA macro from being expanded to something not intended.
	  I'm not sure there was a problem, just saw the dangerous definiton.
	Change malloc() to mem_alloc() in a bunch of formats. The latter sits
	  in memory.c and has error checking.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git and CREDITS-jumbo
	sapG: Add FMT_UTF8 even though we are not FMT_UNICODE.
	Improve valid() in netlm, nethalflm and mssql12.
	Improve valid() in krb5pa formats.
	Explicitly state that wpapsk formats do support WPA and WPA2.
	Update CHANGES-jumbo.git & CREDITS-jumbo
	Merge recent change to DMG CPU format to OpenCL.
	Use 8x for SIMD SHA-1, for gcc >= 4.7 if AVX or XOP.
	Fix OSX build targets for CUDA for Xcode 5.0 and CUDA 5.
	mysql-sha1 formats: SPLIT_UNIFIES_CASE bugfix and unify test vectors.
	Better description of MySQL formats vs. versions.
	Bugfixes from bleeding back-ported to unstable.
	Fixes for building CUDA on OSX Mavericks.
	Makefile CUDA: Add natural path to nvcc with an NVCC macro, and
	  make the OSX -ccbin quirk a macro too.
	CUDA fix for when nvcc is not in /usr/local/bin.
	Drop -cl-strict-aliasing from OpenCL build options. It's deprecated.
	Print a warning when FMT_NOT_EXACT.
	pkzip: Bugfix for #467. Two early rejection tests had to be disabled.
	  Hopefully they can be re-enabled by JimF after some tuning.
	Update CREDITS-jumbo & CHANGES-jumbo.git
	Fix an old bug with CPstoreUTF8 vs. split hashes and --show. Some
	  cracked hashes with passwords containing 8-bit characters would be
	  output as partially uncracked in case CPstoreUTF8 was enabled.
	SAP B passed salts to loader with possible garbage in the end
	  (variable length). This lead to loader potentially seeing
	  "different" salts even though they were the same. Closes #608.
	It turns out krb5-23 are just NT hashes. Drop the krb5-23 format
	  (it was a lot slower) and change kdcdump2john.py so it outputs
	  $NT$ tags for those.
	Add some alternative addresses for Dhiru to .mailmap so Git knows
	  he is one same person

	added JtR tool to_dyna to the build. This tool converts hash:salt or
	  salt:hash into proper dyna format, converting salt to $HEX$ if

	Dynamic fixes, from Jim.
	Here is a patch that removes any plug dependencies.
	1. in formats.c, the 2nd loop in the 'max length' check, should start
	  at 0, not at 1.
	Bug fixes for mask mode.
	Some changes to raw2dyna
	Mask mode bugfix
	Fix generic build (dynamic_generic_fix.diff)
	Bug fixes for dynamic union crypt_key
	SSE2 support for WPA-PSK. The code was taken and modified from my code
	  in mscash2. They are pretty different, due to how the main
	  format logic is (mscash2 split out just the inner function, this
	  one did not break out the crypt). But they do about the same
	  things. Also, in SSE2, mscash2 BE's the binary data. I do not
	  do that here, since the wpapsk.h is common code to
	  CPU/CUDA/OpenCL, and that is where that functionality is. So, there
	  simply is a call to alter_endianity_to_BE when the results are
	  stored at the end of crypt. There really should be no speed
	  impact, due to this fact.
	Here are a couple more fixes
	Implement ldr_sort_salts(), currently hard-coded to only apply to
	  wpapsk formats. In the future we will probably want a format
	  struct entry for format->methods.salt_compare().
	Some porting items. The typecasts are due to void* having an undefined
	  size (on some compilerrs). error C2036: 'void *' : unknown
	  size
	Dynamic: Remove many more of the typecasts, putting them into anon
	  unions.
	listconf.c: Ensure we have a proper version of NSS lib before calling.
	bench.c: Get around a crash in VC (and mingw), in -test=0 mode.
	  These only use clock(), so if the bench is fast, there are 0 clocks
	  used. I simply put a 1 in the time slot, if it is 0.
	mingw port issues
	More mingw port issues
	Another version check for NSPR in listconf.c

	Fixed valid in pwsafe formats
	Fixed valid() in pwsafe formats
	removed rm/remove
	Replace malloc() with mem_alloc() in many places.
	I did some minor changes mostly in opencl/cuda formats. I also

	  clean tables for candidates with just one line of code.
	Changed names of fmt_main structs listed below, to be consistent with
	  naming convention we use most often: -name starts with
	  "fmt_" prefix, or "fmt_opencl", "fmt_cuda" for gpu formats.
	More fmt_main name convention fixes
	Rename CL_VERSION_1_0 macro to HAVE_OPENCL to clean the code a bit.
	Some formats didn't respect -dev option given by command line.

Solar (11):
	hccap2john fixes
	RAdmin, SIP speedup
	sunmd5: minor fixes
	sunmd5: Get rid of modulo
	Sunmd5: Eliminate some more uses of sizeof(string). Also replace one
	  use of MAX_KEYS_PER_CRYPT with count - should help with single
	  crack mode.
	Merge Solar's Jumbo-7 changes selectively.
	Merge Solar's john-1.7.9.6-selftest-1.diff. This was meant to be
	  committed to core -> bleeding-jumbo and we should have it in
	  1.8-unstable-jumbo by now but progress is so slow I (magnum)
	  lost faith. Original comments follow:
	PoC optimization for NTLMv1. Maintain a table for the third DES block.
	Try to speedup cmp_all() by use of a bitmap. This only makes sense
	  when cmp_all() is called multiple times per crypt_all()'s actual
	  processing - that is, when cracking two or more C/R pairs at
	  once. There's a check for that in the code. Moreover, use of
	  the bitmap is automatically disabled when the C/R pair count
	  reduces to 1.
	Licensing files
	Add 'dokuwiki' external mode from
	  http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2013/06/08/14

	Make ciphertext parsing more robust in zip format
	Add support for cracking KDE KWallet files

Vlatko Kosturjak (7):
	Fix: handle error handling better. Helps in debugging OpenCL errors.
	  For example, was getting OpenCL error
	  (CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE) instead of OpenCL error
	  (CL_INVALID_BUILD_OPTIONS) because program did not handle
	  previous error and continued to run even if build did not
	  succeed.
	Fix: If Apple is in question, turn off build options as Apple OpenCL
	  does not like it. At least on Mac Book Pros having ATI Radeon HD
	  6750M.
	Print to stdout without message for consistency
	expose markov stats file as command line option

	  new separate format: We now have mschapv2, mschapv2-bs and
	  mschapv2-naive.
	Add MMX version of DES_bs_crypt_plain().
	netntlm bitsliced conversion

	  seeds that KDE Paste applet uses to generate passwords.
	Add license notice to KDEPaste external mode.

Costin Enache (2):
	Fix for clock err in timers.
	Silly bug in sunmd5 busted the rounds parsing.

Julien Perrot (2):
	add support for sips uri (with explicit port number)
	adds support for sips uri (with explicit port number) when converting
	  input from sipdump

Tavis Ormandy (2):

Michael Ledford (1):
	Adds support for multiple keys existing in an encrypted DMG. When
	  multiple keys are found it selects the first password key header.
	  Adds support for DMG sparseimage files. Previously the first chunk
	  selected could be empty. Now chunk number one is chosen for DMG
	  sparseimage files and a new heuristic is added to the DMG format
	  plugin to look for 'Apple'.

Camille Mougey (1):
	New formats: KRB5-18 and KRB5-23


The following changes were made between 1.7.9-jumbo-6 and 1.7.9-jumbo-7:

magnum (109):
	define REPORT_OPENCL_WARNINGS in bleeding after it was undef'ed in magnum-jumbo
	Version notice for magnum-jumbo
	RAR: make self-test comments more clear about what is what
	Fix for common_opencl_pbkdf2.c for Mac (uint -> unsigned int)
	options.c format list: Workaround for silly Windows bug at column 80
	Brainfart in magnum-jumbo version: it's supposed to be 1.7.9-jumbo-6+unstable, not 1.7.9-jumbo-6+bleeding
	Remove the "unreliable, will miss guesses" from rawsha512-opencl and -cuda after myrice's fixes. They pass the Test Suite.
	Fixes for raw-md4, raw-md5, nt2 and raw-sha1 when *not* using reduced binary size (ie. for bleeding-jumbo)
	Drop the "unreliable, will miss guesses" from xsha512-cuda. It now passes the Test Suite.
	opencl_bf_std.c: replace uint to unsigned int
	Drop the "unreliable, will miss guesses" from xsha512-opencl. It passes the Test Suite now.
	Add a "Section [%s] not found" before outputting the catch-all --list=?
	Merge fix
	raw-md5-opencl: Report human readable errors
	opencl_mscash2_fmt.c did not declare clear_keys static.
	Fix mis-use of CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE in a number of OpenCL formats.
	Version change for Jumbo-7RC, and undefine REPORT_OPENCL_WARNINGS
	Drop a bogus run/pfx2john from the tree
	Fix two declaration-after-statements in MPI code Add run/pfx2john to .gitignore
	Fixes after last patch
	Make clear_keys in dynamic_fmt.c static
	testpara-native test target added
	Allocate one more byte for opencl source. Weird errors seen when not.
	Use common find_best_workgroup() for a number of formats, fixing various problems. Alloc/free kernel source memory instead of mem_calloc_tiny(). Make global_work_size global. Always print diagnostics to stderr.
	Fix a (possible) problem introduced in the previous patch
	Pick a better fallback for optimal_work_group
	raw-md4-opencl added (very near a copy of raw-md5-opencl except kernel)
	common find_best_workgroup(): Use proper GWS when calculating LWS
	Revert the "shared find_best_workgroup" from opencl_xsha512_fmt.c - it had a special loop for calulating 10 samples and made worse without it.
	Fix for global global_work_size
	common-opencl.c: Fix for Apple CPU + do a warm-up run
	Fixes for shared find_best_workgroup(): formats must use profilingEvent. Use a loop targeting half a second. Again, use the shared function for opencl_xsha512_fmt
	Fix LOTS of output in OpenCL formats so they go to stderr (lmgtfy)
	Fix a compiler warning
	Fix sha1-per-key calculation
	opencl_cryptsha512: Errors to stderr, please.
	Use Sayantan's bitselect in RAR kernel (unless nvidia)
	Add keychain2john to .gitignore
	declaration-after-statement in wpapsk.h
	Unify case in hmac formats, and set the flag. Also, fix bugs in rawSHA-2 formats, which claimed they unify, but did not.
	raw SHA2 formats: accept upper- or lowercase hashes
	Fixes after Jim's patch (new-style format interface mixed in)
	Ditch the last pFmt stuff (except in dynamic)
	Add "LC_ALL = C" to Makefile, for better compatibility with some non-GNU systems.
	wordlist.c: fix segfault reported in http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/08/01/5
	pkzip: Drop a now unused label, muting a compiler warning
	Fix the self-test's clear_keys().
	mscash formats: Warn when rejecting too long salts
	rar_fmt: Move new CMIYC tests to the debug section so they don't skew benchmarks
	Update doc/BUGS and add "unreliable" to pwsafe-cuda
	Fix pwsafe-cuda by limiting max length. Also move an endian-swap from crypt_all() to get_salt() - and same fix for opencl format.
	pwsafe-cuda: Bump PLAINTEXT_LENGTH to 32 again, this time with an array size to fit.
	bf-opencl and sha512crypt-opencl: use stderr for diag/error output.
	pwsafe-opencl: merge fixes from -cuda version
	bf-opencl: Workaround for AMD APP problems running this format on CPU. This fix does not affect GPU at all.
	sha1 OpenCL kernels: Fix compiler warnings (on OSX) and optimise a little while at it.
	Revert a buggy change to ldr_load_pot_line() in 1c637ba that lead to segfaults. This may mean $HEX$ fixups for dynamic will be broken again, until fixed some other way.
	RAR: Drop the warning about device being CPU. I have seen OpenCL outperform a CPU-only OMP build by 2.5x.
	wordlist.c: We can't free the word buffer memory upon exit from do_wordlist_crack() because some formats just copy the pointer in set_key() and the final status line will call get_key(). Problem seen with oracle_fmt.
	RAR: Add some early rejects. Huffman table check still TODO
	OpenCL platform/device selection from john.conf was not working properly (it was read too late)
	RAR format: Use mem_alloc() and MEM_FREE().
	RAR: Finally, quite effective early rejection! Verified with almost 70,000 test files, with no false rejects. And we are rejecting over 96% of the candidates without resorting to a slow full check (which in turn may reject semi-early, especially if it's a PPM block)
	RAR: Correct benchmark output when running vectorized.
	RAR: Smaller salt struct. Minor and benign bug fixed.
	RAR bugfix. It's a wonder it worked as good as it did.
	RAR debugging
	Drop the "MaxOrder < 64" constraint - I have files with MaxOrder 165 that was not cracked due to the limit. (-m4, -m5, -mct)
	Change a bunch of ISO-8859-1 source files to UTF-8
	Use LC_ALL=C for plugins' sed incovation in Makefile
	Change all non-ascii copyright signs to (c) in source files.
	RAR: Use mem_alloc_tiny() instead of mem_alloc()
	Accidental spaces in Makefile replaced with TABs (it matters).
	RAR: Memory leak fixed. It was introduced with early reject.
	Update CREDITS-jumbo and CHANGES-jumbo
	RAR: fix a compiler warning on 32-bit
	RACF: Fixed a compiler warning and made format struct forward-compatible
	VNC: Fixed a compiler warning and made format struct forward-compatible
	memory.c: print some clues if alloc() fails. RAR: handle expected bogus alloc sizes (bug introduced in 8f3e452)
	RAR: User-settable max. duration (mitigating kernel exec. timeouts)
	Simplify that last patch a little
	Fixes for OSX's CUDA and OpenCL targets, and add macosx-x86-64-gpu.
	Assorted OpenCL and CUDA fixes needed for OSX. - Always use "static" or "inline" for non-kernel functions. - Avoid comparing integers of different signs. - Change %Zd to %zd - Rename all local implementations of memcpy to _memcpy - change "uint" to "uint32_t"
	OpenCL: Do not add -cl-nv-verbose on OSX
	MPI fix for loopback mode (cosmetical)
	RAR: fixes from magnum-jumbo that should be in -fixes too
	Makefile: Fix for linux-x86-sse2 target
	OSX performance fixes
	gcc 4.7 performance fix
	EPIserver: Add proper Unicode support. A bunch of other formats: Unicode fixes (no problems seen but better safe than sorry).
	RAR: Make check_huffman() less greedy (I had a false assertion-fail, for an invalid data stream)
	RAR: Correct BINARY_SIZE (it should be zero!)
	Raw-SHA1-ng: Set min_keys_per_crypt to 4 to avoid unnecessary performance hit in Single mode.
	Opportunistic copy of john.bash_completion to any (all) present directories out of: /etc/bash_completion.d /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d
	OpenCL auto-find GPU if no specific device requested. Also, an OSX OpenCL fix of unknown importance.
	OpenCL/CUDA: differentiate gpu_id -> ocl_gpu_id and cuda_gpu_id. This was a necessity just waiting to happen.
	A couple fixes for OSX. After this, ALL formats except some OpenCL ones builds and works fine under OSX 10.8 - including with HAVE_NSS, HAVE_KRB5 and HAVE_GMP. The separate make targets vncpcap2john and office2john are tested too and works fine.
	OpenCL tweaks depending on platform. Add a new function get_platform_vendor_id().
	GPU tweaks (cosmetically, if that)
	Office 2007 leaked about 1 KB of memory per second
	Office: Remove a no-op from DeriveKey() and protect us from segfault in GeneratePasswordHashUsingSHA1() in case DeriveKey() returned NULL. Are there cases we don't cover?
	Common-opencl.c: It turns out strcasestr() is not standard, so cease and desist.
	pass_gen.pl: Print a notice if we stop due to --count limit.
	The "arbitrary characters in rules, using \xnn" introduced by Jim in commit ad56c30 did not work for preprocessor ranges. This is now fixed and tested.
	Fix for wpapsk for big-endian, submitted by Sam Novak.
	Drop radmin & pfx formats, and pfx2john. These will be in Jumbo-8.
	Added a CHANGES-jumbo.git which is (almost) raw output from "git shortlog", and placed (the changes part of) Solar's announcement of Jumbo-6 in CHANGES-jumbo (mostly as a placeholder, it might need editing).
	Update CREDITS-jumbo
	hmac-sha1 bug fix: Certain optimisations did not take SHA_BUF_SIZ in account. Very few builds pick the old SHA-1 implementation that uses 320 bytes instead of the now normal 64 bytes but native OSX llvm now does, so triggered the bug.

JimF (25):
	SKEY was lacking fmt_default_clear_keys in it's format struct
	pass_gen.pl: Support for sha256crypt and sha512crypt

Solar (9):
	hccap2john fixes
	RAdmin, SIP speedup
	Optimized mscash2-opencl
	Use "unsigned short" rather than simple "short" for single crack mode's buffered key offsets.
	We use "short" for buffered key indices and "unsigned short" for buffered key offsets - make sure these don't overflow.

The following changes were made between 1.7.9-jumbo-5 and 1.7.9-jumbo-6:

magnum (334):
	This patch reverts part of the NT format to using an incorrect and no longer needed length check. That beats me, but it will do until the reason is figured out.
	Changes Makefile test targets for Test Suite 1.10
	Correct truncation for NT format. This time with no performance loss
	External filter now truncates at format's max length. Turn off wordlist memory buffer if an external filter is used (a modification would trash the buffer if a word got longer)
	Reduced verbosity for normal test targets and added verbose ones
	Replace length checks in nt2 too. Strangely enough it is faster with them.
	XSHA intrinsics. Does not support OMP.
	XSHA: added "option" to revert to OpenSSL for OMP builds. Also fixes 32-bit MMX builds.
	XSHA: Added support for OMP with intrinsics
	pass_gen.pl added to run/ directory. This has only been available in separate patches (like the test suite creation scripts) until now, and that version was not up to date. This is a gem for testing stuff.
	XSHA: More optimised salt handling, better OMP scaling
	mysqlSHA1 32-bit set_key() for SSE2
	Bug fixes to lotus5 (OMP builds) and both mssql formats (MMX builds)
	mysql-sha1 set_key tweaks
	Salted-sha1: performance tweaks
	Raw-MD5-unicode made thick again, using much faster code (2x dynamic)
	raw-md5u final fixes (all linux builds pass test suite)
	MD5_std vs intrinsics / arch.h PARA fixes. Never disable SSE for MD5, revert to 4x instead.
	mssql05 hash functions size 5 & 6
	Oracle11: Added intrinsics
	Oracle11 optimisations
	drop cmpt_cp.pl and mkdumb16.pl (will be placed in the separate patch)
	corrected a typo in the PARA gcc version tests
	Adapt trip_fmt to Jumbo
	Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics to sapB as well as lots of optimisation.
	Fixed bug in unicode.c where specifically giving --enc=raw did not work as expected
	sapB: Various fixes. Max salt length 12 (changed self-test hash). Changed cur_salt to struct pointer. Non-SSE builds fixes. Replace 8-bit characters with '^'.
	sapG: Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics. Decreased salt length to 36 (12 x UTF-8) (changed self-test hash).
	sapB and sapG: re-worked valid() for variable salt length. We still support the old format (padded with spaces to 40 characters) but also non-padded.
	make testpara target, for determining best SSE_PARA values
	hmac-MD5 optimisations. 32-bit set_key().
	RawSHA1: Optimised set_key() for some 17% speedup.
	PARA tweaks from Solar's tests
	testpara: decrease threshold for accepting a higher value from 5% to 1%.
	sapB bugfix for 8-bit salts
	sapG minor fix in get_salt() (only affected over-long salts)
	sap_prepare.pl renamed to sap2john.pl and changed not to pad salt
	sapB: Various bugfixes. Use enc_strupper() for proper uc of UTF-8, but init the Unicode system in a way so it does not uppercase double-s
	sapG: Various bugfixes. New cleaning mechanism. Seems to work fine now. Intermediate key will never be longer than 192 bytes, decreased max number of limbs to three. Dropped the internal UTF-8 conversion. It was never appropriate. sapG now behaves like any other 8-bit format. If you want UTF-8, feed UTF-8.
	sapG: Optimisations, 30% boost (now 2x compared to Jumbo-5)
	HDAA: OMP support
	sapG Bugfixes. Insufficient key cleaning in rare cases plus a really hideous bug in "magic array" enumeration.
	sapB: key cleaning bugfix. This was a mean one. Weird algo.
	HDAA: get rid of a compiler warning
	sapB & sapG minor optimisations
	sapB & sapG: trim trailing spaces from (truncated) plaintext. Raise sapG plaintext length (for UTF-8 encodings of long passwords) Warn if --encoding=utf8 is used/not used depending on format: these formats are well defined in that aspect.
	DragonFly BSD crypt-SHA2 formats added. Should work for 32-bit "versions" of the bugs in them.
	OMP support for raw-sha2 and DragonFly sha2 formats
	DragonFly, cosmetic
	Crypt-SHA2 formats using OpenSSL and with OMP support
	Copyright and license statements overhaul
	Fixes in a number of formats after failing new self-tests. A few of them were probably real bugs.
	Revert the not strictly needed fixes from last commit. Add a couple other fixes.
	Deprecated raw-md5 thin (moved to unused) in favour of thick version
	IPB2: fix in binary(), it was reading twice the size of ciphertext and probably overwriting something.
	Change #include "omp.h" to #include <omp.h> in a number of formats.
	SHA-crypt-256/512: Change benchmark to only output raw figure since there is no difference between one/many salts. Also output "rounds=5000".
	Drop x86-ssei.h in favor of x86-sse.h, add tests that disable intrinsics for gcc older than 3.4.6 (the oldest we know work at all) and fallback to asm. This means the sse2/sse2i targets now work similar to 64/64i for newer versions of gcc, that is, sse2i just means "precompiled intrinsics".
	MSCHAPv2 salt() alignment
	DragonFly SHA formats: Add 64-bit versions (in same format files: dual structs)
	loader.c: fix for --user=<uid> when loading pwdump files
	bugfix for previous patch
	loader.c: restore the defined-out block for DES bare hashes with whitespace salt.
	DragonFly formats: cosmetics
	Make all sse2i targets use x86-sse.h. Add new test target linux-x86-64-32-sse2asm.
	sapG fix for long candidates (over 64 octets)
	Jim's new SHA-1 intrinsics. Uses 16x4 buffer instead of 80x4. Improved "make testpara32" to compare asm figures too. Updated SHA1_SSE_PARA for 16x4 code. New pre-compiled intrinsics.
	Dragonfly formats: Type-cast void pointer arithmetic
	Adds --max-run-time=N option, for graceful exit after N seconds of cracking.
	Makes --max-run-time disregard init & loading times
	Correct a bug in the "double10" external mode
	pass_gen.pl: Show usage blob when no options given
	pass_gen.pl: Add salted sha-1 (of any length up to 16) and fix bugs in base64 encoding
	Salted SHA-1: Support any salt size
	Change MPI defaults to be more stable (no MPI_Barrier nor MPI_Abort)
	sapG: add const for safety/optimisations
	More randomness for HDAA in pass_gen.pl (lengths etc)
	md5-mmx.S: new interface needed for multi-limb (>55 bytes) crypts (for HDAA)
	HDAA intrinsics, 3x original speed
	Wordlist.c hack for reading candidates from a pot file: 1. if --wordlist given without a name, use default pot file 2. if wordlist name (after 1) ends in .pot, parse it as such
	Added hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha256 formats. Added wikipedia self-tests to sha-md5
	Added hmac-sha224/384/512 (and made hmac-sha256 a non-plug like these)
	Changed benchmark type to raw for all HMAC formats
	SAP B format: Optimisations
	sapG: made "theMagicArray" static const. This alone made a 4% boost
	sapB regression fix
	Wordlist mode: Fix dupe suppression for non-buffered mode. Make the pot file parsing mode aware of any custom field separator.
	Replace the muting of "#!comment" lines when in memory buffer mode
	sapB bugfix for generic builds
	wordlist.c MPI fix for dupe suppression in non-buffered mode. We must incrementent the line counter when skipping, because the different nodes will have different views of what is a dupe.
	sse2i_winfix.pl modified so it can handle any .S file
	Copyright/license statements
	More copyright/license blurbs
	IPB2: OMP & intrinsics support, over 3x speed
	IBP2: 32-bit mmx/sse fixes
	hmacSHA1: Support key lengths >64
	All hmac formats: Support key lengths >64
	All hmac-SHA formats: fix for salt containing '#' and self-tests for keys larger than pad size (n/a for sha-384/512 as of now due to lack of support from John itself for lengths gt 125)
	New format: Drupal7 (non-plug, OpenSSL >= 0.9.8, OMP)
	Copyright/license stuff
	Add missing opencl-mysql declarations to john.c
	Windows fixes for new sse2/sse2i scheme
	Change Unicode tables to const - might help the optimiser
	Unified make target linux-x86-64-gpu including both CUDA and OpenCL. Also adds intrinsics to the 32-bit CUDA and OpenCL targets.
	change -lcrypto -lssl to -lssl -lcrypto (helps static linking)
	options.c: Sort formats list
	New para-best.pl for "make testpara"
	options.c: enable format name printing all the way to 80th column
	options.c fixed erroneus output of \0
	NT-OpenCL: Add FMT_UNICODE flag
	loader.c: Do read gecos and homedir from pwdump-style input. http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/02/22/1
	Makefile typo (cosmetic)
	Manual sync with Samuele's tree's b890a51
	Support specifying OpenCL platform on command line
	Add a trivial platform/device lister (to unused/ for now). The plan is to make JtR capable of outputting this list.
	Mute compilation log if it's no more than a line-feed
	Correct BENCHMARK_LENGTH for raw-sha1-opencl
	Rename sha-crypt-256/512 to cryptsha256/512
	OpenCL: rename -gpu to -device and support -platform=LIST (or -device=LIST)
	Drop the separate listocldev.c
	Auto memory size suffixes when listing devices
	rar_fmt: 15% speedup if ARCH_LITTLE_ENDIAN && ARCH_ALLOWS_UNALIGNED. This version can successfully crack non-hp archives with method "store" ("m0b") without spawning unrar. Also fixed a bad memory leak. rar2john: Pick best candidate from RAR file. Prefer stored files over compressed, and prefer smaller files over larger.
	Fix for gpu builds imlicitly using pre-built icc intrinsics
	RAR format: Proper support for -p mode. OMP Support and optimisations.
	RAR: Do not prefer zero-byte files. Use basename of filename for user. Improve error output at salt loading. Clean up rar2john variable definitions.
	rar2john: Handle Unicode file names. Less output unless -DDEBUG.
	Fix for Unicode filenames. We need to zero the whole buffer between files.
	Proof of concept patch for OpenCL options in john.conf
	Make the RACF format a plugin
	Fix for -subformat=list. The config file was not yet read so we could not get info for user formats.
	SIPdump added. Needs libpcap-dev so for now it's a separate make target "make SIPdump"
	Add LDFLAGS to SIPdump build target
	Cosmetic changes to cryptsha256/512 (CPU)
	ssha-opencl: If KPC was requested, use it when enumerating LWS
	Revert "ssha-opencl: If KPC was requested, use it when enumerating LWS". This did not work well.
	Fix for cryptsha512-opencl in -gpu and OSX -opencl targets
	Revert enabling of OMP in Makefile that was introduced in 0763f0d
	Fix for OpenCL/CUDA targets w/ pre-built intrinsics
	Fixed over-allocation in all OpenCL SHA-1 kernels. They used 320 bytes per key buffer instead of just 64.
	New pre-built intrinsics for latest sse-intrinsics.c icc version 12.1.0
	Add Local Memory Type, LE/BE and ECC info to OpenCL device list.
	ssha-opencl: Move salt and datai buffers preparation away from crypt_all() just for good measure. There might be a miniscule speedup for single-salt.
	common-opencl.c: Add -DDEVICE_IS_CPU to the build options when applicable, for self-adjusting kernels.
	mozilla2john: Error (and usage) to stderr Makefile: revert OMPFLAGS (please stop committing that!)
	Mozilla_fmt bugfix: globalSalt array was smaller than needed, causing segfaults. This should be forwarded to the FireMasterLinux project.
	Mozilla_fmt: corrected updating of cracked[] array. Also set BENCHMARK_LENGTH (possibly temporarily) for seeing how the upcoming get/set_salt() fix will affect performance.
	Enable atexit() in opencl_cryptmd5_fmt.c and opencl_phpass_fmt.c just to get rid of compiler warnings
	RAR format: OpenCL support added (in the same one format). Support for AES-NI instructions by using OpenSSL EVP instead of low-level calls. Experimental support for reverting to CPU in Single mode (when doing a lot fewer than max keys per crypt in a batch). Currently #defined out. Added inline storing of RAR data in input file when files are small enough. Added lots of self-tests. Default to use same length tests as cRARk. Changed format tag from $rar3$ to $RAR3$ to enforce re-running rar2john. Moved slow code from set_salt() to get_salt() and keep all allocations during the whole run.
	Set OS_TIMER to 0 in arch.h if AMD APP SDK in installed and building OpenCL, or if mingw is used to build 64-bit Windows build.
	Silly me forgot an #endif in x86-64.h
	RAR: Mute warning about AES-NI engine (it may be false) fix comments
	RAR: Re-introduce find_best_kpc() - only used when specifically saying KPC=0
	sapB optimisations and sap2john overhaul
	RACF: trivial fix to mute a compiler warning for non-OMP builds
	RAR fixes for OpenCL. Better error handling (especially if -DDEBUG). Now works fine on AMD Cedar (previously segfaulted).
	RAR: minor optimisations. Enable fallback to CPU in Single mode (it's safe now)
	A couple more .gitignore entries
	Make hmacMD5 a non-plugin in order to force it to load after mscash2. Now only hmacSHA1 was a plugin of all hmac's so I threw it in as well.
	Create doc/CHANGES-jumbo, generated from commit descriptions
	Remove obsolete file opencl/PBKDF2.cl
	Fix a typo in common-opencl.c
	Cryptsha512-opencl Makefile fix for 32-bit build targets
	RAR: various optimisations.
	RAR (OpenCL): drop all use of byte_addressable_store. This also avoids lots of endian swapping. Added four versions of RawPsw, one for each aligment, and copy 32-bits at a time whenever possible.
	RAR: Tweak auto-tuning. Unroll first loop. Do endian swapping only once when preparing RawPsw.
	RAR: KPC enumeration tweaks
	RAR: Made us of local memory optional (default disabled). Re-added find_best_workgroup() and tweaked adjusting to device. Found a way to reduce register use by 16, all else equal.
	RAR: Optimisations for GTX580. Now 4400 c/s. Major overhaul of auto tuning.
	Office format: Unicode support
	RAR: Better granularity w/ KPC=0 (vs auto-homing). Auto-define NVIDIA from cl_nv_pragma_unroll for architecture tweaks. Bump plaintext length for better coalescion. Init lengths to 6 so the self-tests don't end up wildly diverging threads (when it just sets a few keys out of thousands).
	RAR: Fix LWS at 64, there is no point in evaluating it.
	RAR: Decrease register use a lot, only one RawPsw buffer. KPC tweaks. Get rid of the switch (for AMD) in sha_final() using a new bit flip macro. Optional fixed length in kernel. Approaching 10,000 c/s on HD 7950
	RAR: Minor optimisations verified on GTX580. Self-test length fixes. Unroll inner loop by four for fixed-length kernels, dropping a switch statement.
	RAR: Disable the 4x inner loop unrolling for AMD, it was detrimental
	RAR: Use vectorized memcpy if AMD
	RAR: Drop impossible conditionals for unrolled nvidia code.
	RAR: Vectorize output copy for AMD. This too made an unintuitive boost.
	Added hccap2john to .gitignore
	common-opencl.c: Add -cl-nv-verbose if device is nvidia
	Include a vectorized kernel in same file as non-vectorized. It is not used yet. Add an opencl-rar.h file.
	RAR: Disable fixed_len that was accidentally active
	RAR: Remove a debugging notice unless actually debugging
	Added a note about bash completion in the "Notes to packagers" in params.h
	Fix a typo in bash completion
	Fixes for bash completion's Makefile target
	More fixes for bash completion make target
	common-opencl.[ch]: Added some nvidia-specific stuff. Also ran indent on it because it was a mess.
	New (hidden) options: --list=[inc-modes|rules|externals|ext-filters|ext-modes] to be used by bash completion as well as GUI's and other things.
	New hidden option: --list=ext-filters-only. Unlike --list=ext-filters, this does not include modes that also has generate()
	New hidden options --list=build-info and --list=<section> Also includes Solar's patch for compiler.c
	--list: Missing CR for icc version output. Removed FLG_STDOUT.
	Version string now reflecting magnum-jumbo (1.7.9-jumbo-5+unstable)
	Add -list=hidden-options
	bash completion now including incremental/external modes and rules
	Tab vs space in doc/RULES
	RAR: Separate FIXED_LEN from vectorizing (the latter needs the former but on nvidias we may only want the former).
	RAR: Fix EVP and unrar memory leaks. Early reject if rar_decode_number would return > MaxNum. Experimental fuzzy early rejection found by Milen.
	RAR: reverted experimental early reject, it produced false negatives. Added lots of comments to unrar code, from original sources.
	RAR: Added a reject test from Milen
	Move some --list= options handling earlier, so we can show it even if we lack a config file.
	RAR: Another early reject found by Milen. This was already in place but we might bail out just a little sooner with this test.
	SHA0: use the basic function names since they're static anyway. This format is good as a template for unsalted formats and sha1_gen_fmt_plug.c is good for salted ones, as they don't contain any SSE2 or such complications.
	Mute NSS/pkg-config warnings for LDFLAGS
	Updated doc/CHANGES-jumbo and started to hand-edit it. More needed.
	Updated doc/CHANGES-jumbo
	Add run/opencl_bf_std.h to .gitignore
	mozilla format: support new get_source() core
	NT2: Simpler prepare() without mallocs, as Jim did to NT_fmt

	get_source(): self test
	Mute a compiler warning when building RAR in 32-bit
	nt2 and raw-md5: Add get_source() functions
	Raw-sha1: add get_source()
	Make the last patch work on non-Windows
	Revert get_source() function for now (it's still in bleeding-jumbo)
	Move bash completion script to run directory in case a packager forgets about it
	Fix a couple of compiler warnings
	Revert hash and buffer sizes for unique, accidentally committed by Jim in 514c059
	mscash: bugfix for codepage version of get_salt()
	Alignment fixes in mysqlSHA1 and rawSHA0 binary()
	Revert "Fix: improve build on multi-GPU environment."
	Add new john.conf options subsections Markov, MPI and Jumbo and add a new config item CrackStatus under Options:Jumbo. Note: If CrackStatus=Y in john.conf, the --crack-status option disables it.
	Drop the "Jumbo" subsection of john.conf, leave those items at the top [Options] section.
	Add --list=subformats and deprecate --subformat=list
	List --subformat as a hidden option now (for --format=crypt benchmark)
	Mute a compiler warning for raw2dyna.c
	Make raw-sha (sha0) a non-plug so it always gets lower precedence than sha1
	RAR: change KPC to GWS
	Rest of OpenCl formats: Change KPC to GWS in john.conf and environment variables
	john.conf typos in comments (external:double)
	c3_fmt.c: fix typos, raw-sha vs cryptsha
	README.mpi minor updates
	Updated doc/CHANGES-jumbo. We now have 516 commits since Jumbo-5 but this is reduced to currently 172 lines in this file.
	A couple minor changes to CHANGES-jumbo.
	Source $JOHN/john.local.conf by default. This file is never overwritten but will be created empty when building, if it does not exist. It must *not* be included in any release tarball.
	Create a rule section "Extra" for the previously commented-out rules for Single mode. Also, add new rules "Single-Extra" (consisting of Single plus Extra) and "Jumbo" (consisting of all rules we have, including NT). I preserved the name "All" for local use, thus using "Jumbo" instead.
	External:Keyboard: Fixes for 8-bit characters vs signed char constants. http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/02/26/2
	Makefile: Never overwrite john.local.conf when building
	Add --list=[encodings|opencl-devices]. Deprecate --encodings=LIST (but it's still supported). We will later support --list=cuda-devices too. Drop --device=list and --platforms=list (not supported from now on). For the catch-all of --list=<subsection>, add a header "Subsections of...".
	RAR: Support files larger than 2 GB.
	Add --list=formats, listing all formats in the order they are registered.
	Update doc/OPTIONS and doc/README.opencl
	Some more .gitignore entries
	wordlist.c: True dupe suppression for buffer mode, code based on unique.c
	CUDA device lister: Handle error conditions.
	john.c: Alter output from --list=? a little, working around a problem with how bash completion was parsing it. Also add a function prototype for cuda_device_list().
	CUDA: Add some info to device list. Fix compiler warnings.
	Added a stub doc/CREDITS-jumbo based on git author data, and manually edited.
	Updated doc/OPTIONS and doc/CHANGES-jumbo
	mscash2 sizeof() bug fix after the Sparc fixes.
	wordlist.c: Fix a compiler warning on 32-bit
	Revert "bf-opencl: performance and stability update". It broke building.
	Fix line endings in a couple of files that were in DOS format.
	mscash2-opencl: Fix a typo that merely led to a compiler warning
	Fix line endings in opencl_mscash2_fmt.c again
	mscash2-opencl: Fix a typo that merely led to a compiler warning

	Fix compiler warnings in Tavis' SHA-1 format
	When using --log-stderr, don't produce a log file
	taviso_fmt.c: Replace memrchr with strrchr. Add $dynamic_12$ tag like other raw SHA1 formats use. The format announced FMT_SPLIT_UNIFIES_CASE which was not correct until now.
	Updates to CHANGES-jumbo and CREDITS-jumbo
	Add 32-bit "native" build targets
	tavis_fmt.c: Fix a memory leak.
	taviso_fmt: Fix for strrchr vs full-length keys.
	Fix incorrect $dynamic_12$ tag in raw sha1 formats to $dynamic_26$
	Do NOT delete ../run/john.local.conf on "make clean"
	Fix 64-bit native target (we need -march=native in ASFLAGS too)
	Rename rawSHA1_LinkedIn_fmt_plug.c to rawSHA1_linkedIn_fmt_plug.c so it registers *after* the normal raw-sha1 format.
	Another fix for john.local.conf
	Fixes for -native build target
	Updated CHANGES-jumbo
	-march=native implies -mtune=native
	raw-sha1_li format: Fix bug that would give false negatives from cmp_all()
	Reduced binary for raw-md4, raw-md5, raw-sha1 and NT2. This decreases memory usage with 3 bytes per loaded hash for NT/MD4/MD5 and 4 bytes for SHA1 and should help keeping good stuff in cache.
	Reduced binary size #ifdefs
	XSHA_fmt_plug.c: Fix bug introduced by Sparc fixes
	Closed-loop mode: Print name of pot file
	Fix mySQLSHA1 and sha1gen bugs from Sparc fixes. All should be OK now.

	Alignment fix in raw-sha1-linkedin
	New (hidden) option --length=N for reducing plaintext length of a format, mostly for testing purposes.
	Add new options --loopback[=FILE] and --dupe-suppression (the former implies the latter) and revert some stuff for backwards compatibility. NOTE: I had to free up some option flags that was not really needed. But we are now OUT OF them!
	Requested CREDITS-jumbo fix
	Reflect new format names in CHANGES-jumbo
	Move --field-separator-char to hidden option
	Make GPU builds (for Linux 64-bit) -march=native
	Make --log-stderr a hidden option

	Remove two unused variables from opencl_bf_std.c
	Fix a (clang) compiler warning in MYSQL_fast_fmt_plug.c
	Move MYSQL_fmt_plug.c to unused/, rename MYSQL_fast_fmt_plug.c to mysql_fmt_plug.c and change its label to just mysql
