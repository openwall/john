Dynamic 'self-describing' format.  (a.k.a. dynamic expression compiler)

This is a new mode, that really opens up ease of use, for creating and using
'dynamic' formats. This format is based upon work done in the dynamic format
to allow 'thin' formats to be able to provide their own script to run. Thus
thin formats are no longer tied to the concept of having to create a 100%
valid dynamic sub-format, to be able to link to it by a thin dynamic. Now
a thin format is able to create a brand new hash, that has never been part
of dynamic at all. Once that code was done and working (documented in the
DYNAMIC readme file), it allowed taking this one step further. That step is
to not even require a thin format to be created!  By incorporating a parsing
and compiling component, that is able to read a specific properly built
expression, and generate valid script data for that expression, we can
now build a brand new hashing function within JtR with absolutely no
coding required by the end user.  This is truly a breakthrough in end
user ease of usage.

At the current time, the only way to tell John the expression for this
new format, is within the --format= command line. Here is an example.

./john input.txt --format=dynamic='sha512(ripemd320($s.$p).$p)'

NOTE, there likely will have to be shell quoting done. For unix, you
will likely have to use single quotes.  To see what is needed, use
echo as a test.  So  echo 'sha1($p)'   should show sha1($p) for unix.
echo "sha1($p)" in unix shows sha1() which is NOT right. The shell
ate our $p symbol.

This will read all items from the input.txt file, which are of this
format:    hex_128_bytes$salt     It will then perform the hashing
denoted by the above expression, and look for password matches.

Here is the expression language used.  NOTE, this same expression language
is also found in the run/pass_gen.pl engine. There are a few deviations
(such as more crypt types in John than pass_gen), but in all, the language
is very similar, in fact the parsing engine in john was ported from the
parser in pass_gen.pl.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the reference documentation for how to properly create expressions,
and for the limitations to the expression language:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The expression MUST be a single crypt-hash expression. That means that
only a single hash starts the expression, and there are not multiple
hashes appended to each other.
  so  md5($p) is valid,
  but md5($p).md5($p) is NOT valid

All concatenation must have a dot '.' character between it.
  so  md5($p.$p) is valid, but md5($p$s) is not valid.

Variables:
  $s or $salt is used for the 'salt' constant
  $s2 is used for the 2nd salt constant
  $p or $pass is used for the password being tried
  $u is for the user id (which is the first field in the input file)
  $c1 to $c8. These are set as 'constants'. NOTE, they must be used
    in order, i.e. if you have a $c2, then you should have a $c1 already.
    so md5($s.$c1.$p.$c1),c1=x   gives us  md5($s."x".$p."x")

Casing (note: only a few things can be cased)
  lc($u) is for lower case of the user name (proper unicode lower casing)
  uc($u) is for upper case of the user name (again, proper unicode up casing)
  lc($p) and uc($p) are for lower/upper casing the password.
** If uc($u) or lc($u) are used in the expression, then ALL $u must be done
   the same way.  This also applies to the password.
   so md5($u.$p.$u) is valid, but md5(uc($u).$p.$u) is not valid
   This is a limitation of the dynamic format in general.
   When using constants, they must be appended with commas to the end of
     the expression.  NOTE, if there are any ':' chars used in constants
     then these constants must be added with an escape. An example is:
     md5($c1.$p),c1=test_\x3a_test  Which is md5("test_:_test".$p)

Grouping.  All expressions must be a single 'outer' expression, but within
  that outer expression, can be a lot of grouped data. Functions start
  with a function name, and use ( and ) to group data within what is used
  within the hash.  So things like md5($p) or md5(md5(md5($s.$p))) or
  md5(md5($p).$s.md5($s.$p)) are valid, since they all have a single outer
  expression, with proper matching grouping characters for each hash function.

The hashing functions come in multiple 'flavors', doing slightly different
  things. examples: md5(exp) MD5(exp) md5_raw(exp) md5_64(exp) md5_64c(exp)
  There is the lower case hash (like md5(...)) It returns its results
  as a lower case base16 number. So md5("password") would return
  5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99,  Upper case of the hash, returns the
  upper cased base16 hash. So MD5("password") would return
  5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99.  the hash with _raw appended, is simply
  the 'raw' binary blob returned by the hash.  So md5_raw("password") would
  give us the 16 byte binary that starts with byte '\0x5f' and 15 others.
  md5_64("password") returns the mime base-64 result which is
  X03MO1qnZdYdgyfeuILPmQ   md5_64c("password") returns the crypt alphabet
  base-64 string which is LorACpebNRMRUmTSi69DaE.  Normally, the _64 and
  _64c are used as the outer function, informing john what the input
  hash type 'looks' like (i.e. the hashes are in base-64). Same goes
  for the upper case. If the outer function is up case, then only
  upper cased hex strings of the right length will be valid.

The hashing functions (each have a lc, uc, _raw, _64 and _64c version)
  are:   md2, md4, md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, tiger,
         sha3_224, sha3_256, sha3_384, sha3_512, keccak_256, keccak_512,
         ripemd128, ripemd160, ripemd256, ripemd320, whirlpool, gost,
         skein224, skein256, skein384, skein512, panama,
         haval_128_3, haval_128_4, haval_128_5,
         haval_160_3, haval_160_4, haval_160_5,
         haval_192_3, haval_192_4, haval_192_5,
         haval_256_3, haval_256_4, haval_256_5,

These functions can be intermixed in pretty much any way. So a hash of
  sha512(md5(panama($p).$s.ripmd128($s.$p)))  is perfectly 'valid'.
