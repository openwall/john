Please, read INSTALL for general information about installing John on your system.

== Preamble

    Important: it's actually about a local to a user's home directory, not a
    system-wide installation. In fact, most likely you do not need to install
    John the Ripper system-wide.  Instead, after you compile the source code
    (see below), you may simply enter the "run" directory and invoke John from
    there, e.g., ./john --list=build-options.

    Commands not explicitly prefixed by sudo must be run as a regular user
    (the one that will use JtR) rather than as root.

== How to install on Fedora

   If anything below fails, run 'sudo dnf update' and re-try.

=== Preconditions and Required stuff

    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf install git gcc openssl-devel

==== Recommended (extra formats and performance)

    sudo dnf install yasm gmp-devel libpcap-devel bzip2-devel

=== Clone latest bleeding-edge Jumbo and build

==== Clone GIT repo

    mkdir -p ~/src
    cd ~/src
    git clone git://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper -b bleeding-jumbo john

==== Build

    cd ~/src/john/src
    # For MPI, use './configure --enable-mpi' below
    ./configure && make -s clean && make -sj4

=== Test your build

    $ ../run/john --test=0

=== Benchmark your build

    $ ../run/john --test
