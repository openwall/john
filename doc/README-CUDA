README CUDA:
If you have problems with JtR CUDA support:
  Please check that paths to yours CUDA library are proper in Makefile:
    CUDAPATH = /usr/local/cuda/lib
    CUDA64PATH = /usr/local/cuda/lib64
  Please check that yours PATH contains cuda lib,bin and include paths.
  Please check that yours LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains cuda lib path

Performance issues:
  If you have got Fermi or newer card change "-arch sm_10" to "-arch sm_20" in the NVCC_FLAGS (Makefile). If you have Kepler or newer, you can experiment with using "-arch sm_30" as well.
  Default THREADS and BLOCKS settings might not be optimal.
  To get better performance you can experiment with THREADS and BLOCKS macros defined for each format in cuda*.h file.
