Creation of firmware uploadable onto USB device controller.
It might turn out that 'inouttraffic' firmware already has all the required functions and application developer would skip this step.

Assuming ZTEX 1.15y board is connected, the developer is familiar with Ztex SDK and got tests from Ztex SDK working.

- Get, unpack ZTEX SDK
- Install SDCC (Small Devices C Compiler) as recommended in ZTEX SDK manual
- Create ztex/examples/usb-fpga-1.15y/inouttraffic folder. Inside the folder:
-- copy files from examples/usb-fpga-1.15y/intraffic
-- place inouttraffic.c there
-- edit Makefile replacing 'intraffic' with 'inouttraffic'
- make

Versions used:
- ztex-140813b
- SDCC 3.6.0 #9615 (MINGW32)

There's already a built firmware file (inouttraffic.ihx).
