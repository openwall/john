/* Awesome Password Generator RNG replay

 * This takes advantage of a subtle bug, where a crypto RNG is used to
 * seed the C# System.Random() class, which takes a 32-bit input, but
 * converts negative numbers into non-negative numbers, resulting in
 * only 31 bits of security.
 *
 * This only implements "easy to type" being *unticked*, and numbers,
 * lowers, uppers and symbols being ticked, in random password mode.
 * Changing the password length is easy, anything else is left as an
 * exercise to the reader.
 *
 * Running Awesome Password Generator (1.3.2 or lower) in Mono is still
 * vulnerable, but uses a different RNG, so this mode isn't compatible.
 */

/* Awesome Password Generator 1.3.2 does a two-pass run, selecting which
